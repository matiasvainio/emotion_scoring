nation of incredible decent faithful and peaceloving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very very successful and good We are a truly magnificent nationAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans It can never be toleratedNow more than ever we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destinyFour years ago I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency I had not spent my career as a politician but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America firstSo I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena but an arena nevertheless with all sorts of potential if properly done America had given me so much and I wanted to give something backTogether with millions of hardworking patriots across this land we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world It was about America First because we all wanted to make America great again We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens Our agenda was not about right or left it wasnt about Republican or Democrat but about the good of a nation and that means the whole nationWith the support and prayers of the American people we achieved more than anyone thought possible Nobody thought we could even come closeWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history We slashed more jobkilling regulations than any administration had ever done before We fixed our broken trade deals withdrew from the horrible TransPacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord renegotiated the onesided South Korea deal and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA  thats Mexico and Canada  a deal thats worked out very very wellAlso and very importantly we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China made a great new deal with China But before the ink was even dry we and the whole world got hit with the China virus Our trade relationship was rapidly changing billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the US but the virus forced us to go in a different directionThe whole world suffered but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built Without the foundations and footings it wouldnt have worked out this way We wouldnt have some of the best numbers weve ever hadWe also unlocked our energy resources and became the worlds numberone producer of oil and natural gas by far Powered by these policies we built the greatest economy in the history of the world We reignited Americas job creation and achieved recordlow unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women  almost everyoneIncomes soared wages boomed the American Dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years It was a miracle The stock market set one record after another with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation 401ks are at a level theyve never been at before Weve never seen numbers like weve seen and thats before the pandemic and after the pandemicWe rebuilt the American manufacturing base opened up thousands of new factories and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the USATo make life better for working families we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largestever expansion of funding for childcare and development We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrowWhen our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic we produced not one but two vaccines with recordbreaking speed and more will quickly follow They said it couldnt be done but we did it They call it a medical miracle and thats what theyre calling it right now a medical miracleAnother administration would have taken 3 4 5 maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine We did in nine monthsWe grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for allWhen the virus took its brutal toll on the worlds economy we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen We passed nearly 4 trillion in economic relief saved or supported over 50 million jobs and slashed the unemployment rate in half These are numbers that our country has never seen beforeWe created choice and transparency in healthcare stood up to big pharma in so many ways but especially in our effort to get favorednations clauses added which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the worldWe passed VA Choice VA Accountability Right to Try and landmark criminal justice reformWe confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as writtenFor years the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nations borders I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in US history We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safeWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place This includes historic agreements with Mexico Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wallWe restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad The world respects us again Please dont lose that respectWe reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the onesided global deals that never served our interests And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago It was very unfair We were paying the cost for the world Now the world is helping usAnd perhaps most importantly of all with nearly 3 trillion we fully rebuilt the American military  all made in the USA We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years the Space Force And last spring I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many many yearsWe revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never beforeWe obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader al Baghdadi We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the worlds top terrorist Iranian butcher Qasem SoleimaniWe recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan HeightsAs a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East Nobody believed it could happen The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony not violence and bloodshed It is the dawn of a new Middle East and we are bringing our soldiers homeI am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new warsAbove all we have reasserted the sacred idea that in America the government answers to the people Our guiding light our North Star our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America Our allegiance is not to the special interests corporations or global entities its to our children our citizens and to our nation itselfAs President my top priority my constant concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families I did not seek the easiest course by far it was actually the most difficult I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism I took on the tough battles the hardest fights the most difficult choices because thats what you elected me to do Your needs were my first and last unyielding focusThis I hope will be our greatest legacy Together we put the American people back in charge of our country We restored selfgovernment We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten because everyone matters and everyone has a voice We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity equal treatment and equal rights because we are all made equal by God Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect to have their voice heard and to have their government listen You are loyal to your country and my administration was always loyal to youWe worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld our heroes honored our history preserved and lawabiding citizens are never taken for granted Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together Its incredibleNow as I leave the White House I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share As the worlds most powerful nation America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves a loss of confidence in our national greatness A nation is only as strong as its spirit We are only as dynamic as our pride We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our peopleNo nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values history and heroes for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitalityWhat has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history We must never lose this conviction We must never forsake our belief in AmericaThe key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity That means focusing on what we have in common the heritage that we all shareAt the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression free speech and open debate Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America Its not even thinkable Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditionsIn America we dont insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes We just dont do that America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree Thats not who we are It will never be who we areFor nearly 250 years in the face of every challenge Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage confidence and fierce independence These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West It was the same profound love of our Godgiven freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into spaceAs I think back on the past four years one image rises in my mind above all others Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route there were thousands and thousands of people They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great American flag It never failed to deeply move me I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me they came out to show me their support and love for our countryThis is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history We are and must always be a land of hope of light and of glory to all the world This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turnFor the past four years I have worked to do just that From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore I fought for you I fought for your family I fought for our country Above all I fought for America and all it stands for  and that is safe strong proud and freeNow as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning Theres never been anything like it The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the dayAs long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve Our communities will flourish Our people will be prosperous Our traditions will be cherished Our faith will be strong And our future will be brighter than ever beforeI go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart an optimistic spirit and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children the best is yet to comeThank you and farewell God bless you God bless the United States of America
My fellow Americans I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week As I have said the incursion of the US capitol struck at the very heart of our republic It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum I want to be very clear I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nations most sacred traditions and values Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement You are attacking it and you are attacking our country We cannot tolerate it Tragically over the course of the past year made so difficult because of covid19 we have seen political violence spiral out of control We have seen too many riots too many mobs too many acts of intimidation and destruction It must stop whether you are on the right or on the left a democrat or a republican there is never a justification for violence No excuses No exceptions America is a nation of laws Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions calm tempers and help to promote peace in our country There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days both here in Washington and across the country I have been briefed by the US secret service on the potential threats Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way That is your First Amendment right But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order In Washington DC we are bringing in thousands of national guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident Like all of you I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the capitol last week I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderation and grace We will get through this challenge just like we always do I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days These are tense and difficult times The efforts to censor cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous What is needed now is for us to listen to one another not to silence to one another All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor and find common ground and shared purpose We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation delivering the miracle vaccines defeating the pandemic rebuilding the economy protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law Today I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families our communities and our country Thank you God bless you and God bless America

Good evening Id like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election If you count the legal votes I easily win If you count the illegal votes they can try to steal the election from us If you count the votes that came in late  were looking at them very strongly But a lot of votes came in lateIve already decisively won many critical states including massive victories in Florida Iowa Indiana Ohio to name just a few We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media big money and big techAs everybody saw we won by historic numbers And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong They got it knowingly wrong We had polls that were so ridiculous and everybody knew that at the time There was no blue wave that they predicted They thought there was going to be a big blue wave that was false That was done for suppression reasons But instead there was a big red waveAnd its been properly acknowledged actually by the media They were I think very impressed but that was after the fact That doesnt do us any goodWe kept the Senate despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats And in a really  much more competitive states weve  we did a fantastic job with the Senate and I think were very proud of whats happened there We had many more seats to defendThey spent almost 200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone  two races  and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us At the national level our opponents major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests Our major donors were police officers farmers everyday citizens Yet for the first time ever we lost zero races in the House I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today He said he couldnt believe it zero races Very unusual thing Zero And actually won many new seats with I think many more on the wayThis was also the year of the Republican woman More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before Thats a great achievement I won the largest share of nonwhite voters of any Republican in 60 years including historic numbers of Latino African American Asian American and Native American voters  the largest ever in our history We grew our party by 4 million voters the greatest turnout in Republican Party historyDemocrats are the party of the big donors the big media the big tech it seems And Republicans have become the party of the American worker and thats whats happened And were also I believe the party of inclusionAs everyone now recognizes media polling was election interference in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests These really phony polls  I have to call them phony polls fake polls  were designed to keep our voters at home create the illusion of momentum for Mr Biden and diminish Republicans ability to raise funds They were whats called suppression polls Everyone knows that now And its never been used to the extent that its been used on this last electionTo highlight just a few examples The day before election Quinnipiac  which was wrong on every occasion that I know of  had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida and they were off by 84 points And I won Florida easily Easily So they had me losing Florida by a lot and I ended up winning Florida by a lot Other than that they were very accurate They had him up 4 points in Ohio and they were off by 122 points And I also won Ohio  the great state of Ohio  very easilyThe Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin and it was basically even They were off by about 17 points and they knew that Theyre not stupid people They knew that SuppressionThere are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by DemocratsWe were winning in all the key locations by a lot actually And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret and they wouldnt allow legally permissible observers We went to court in a couple of instances and we were able to get the observers put in And when the observers got there they wanted them 60 70 feet away 80 feet 100 feet away  or outside the building to observe people inside the buildingAnd we won a case  a big case And we have others happening There are a lot of  lots of litigation Even beyond our litigation theres tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was and I predicted that Ive been talking about mailin voting for a long time Its  its really destroyed our systemIts a corrupt system And it makes people corrupt even if they arent by nature but they become corrupt its too easy They want to find out how many votes they need and then they seem to be able to find them They wait and wait and then they find themAnd you see that on Election Night We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot  tremendous number of votes And were still ahead by a lot but not as many because theyre finding ballots all of a sudden Oh we have some mailin ballotsIts amazing how those mailin ballots are so onesided too I know that its supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats but in all cases theyre so onesidedWe were up by nearly 700000 votes in Pennsylvania I won Pennsylvania by a lot and that gets whittled down to  I think they said now were up by 90000 votes And theyll keep coming and coming and coming They find them all over And they dont want us to have any observers although we won a court case The judge said you have to have observersLikewise in Geor  and theyre appealing Actually theyre appealing We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers and theyre actually appealing which is sort of interesting I wonder why theyd appeal  that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulationsLikewise in Georgia I won by a lot  a lot  with a lead of over  getting close to 300000 votes on Election Night in Georgia And by the way got whittled down and now its getting to be to a point where Ill go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bitIn Georgia a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours and a lot of things happened The election apparatus in Georgia is run by DemocratsWe also had margins of 300000 in Michigan We were way up in Michigan won the state And in Wisconsin we did likewise fantastically well And that got whittled down Every  in every case they got whittled downToday were on track to win Arizona We only need to carry I guess 55 percent of the remaining vote  55 percent margins And thats a margin that weve significantly exceeded So well see what happens with that but were on track to do okay in ArizonaOur goal is to defend the integrity of the election Well not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election for that matter And we cant allow silence anybody to silence our voters and manufacture resultsIve never had  Ive been doing a lot of public things for a long time Ive never had anything thats been as inspirational by people  calling talking sending things to us Ive never seen such  such love and such affection and such spirit as Ive seen for this People know whats happening and they see whats happening and its before their eyesAnd there are many instances which will be reported very shortly Theres tremendous litigation going on And this is a case where theyre trying to steal an election theyre trying to rig an election and we cant let that happen Detroit and Philadelphia  known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country easily  cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race  a very important presidential raceIn Pennsylvania Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers and very strongly Now we won the case but theyre  theyre going forward They dont want anybody in there They dont want anybody watching them as they count the ballots and I cant imagine why Theres absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process because if its straight they would be  they should be proud of it Instead theyre trying obviously to commit fraud Theres no question about thatIn Philadelphia observers have been kept far away  very far away  so far that people are using binoculars to try and see and theres been tremendous problems caused They put paper on all of the windows so you cant see in and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violentThe 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia the votes have been in by Election Day  that they should be in by Election Day and they werent Votes are coming in after Election Day And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day To the best of my knowledge votes should be in by Election Day and they didnt do thatDemocrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly I really believe that Thats why they did the mailin ballots where theres tremendous corruption and fraud going on Thats why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever And Ive told everybody that these things would happen because Ive seen it happen I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody  in many cases totally unsolicitedThis was unprecedented in American history This was by design Despite years of claiming to care about the election security they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures identities or even determine whether theyre eligible or ineligible to vote People are walking in that they have no idea theyre just taking numbers Theyre writing down things  the workers  and doing a lot of bad things And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that youll see that will shake even you people up and youve seen it allThe officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that youve written about  and for a long time youve been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine I went to school there and I know a lot about it It hasnt changed Its a long time ago and it hasnt changed Its gotten worseIn Pennsylvania partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election and we think much more than that And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever So you dont have postmarks you dont have identification There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit Detroit is another placeSo you dont have postmarks you dont have identification There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit Detroit is another place  and I wouldnt say has the best reputation for election integrityPoll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldnt see what they were doing and it became a little bit dangerousOne major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows again with large pieces of cardboard And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area They didnt want anybody seeing the counting even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be thereIn Detroit there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and  even though the polls closed at eight oclock So they brought it in and the batches came in and nobody knew where they came from Weve also been denied access to observe in critical places in GeorgiaIn multiple swing states counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night with results withheld from major Democratrun locations only to appear later And they certainly appeared and they all had the name Biden on them or just about all  I think almost all They all had the name Biden on them which is a little strangeI challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes Because they talk about votes and I think they should use the word legal  legal votes We want every legal vote counted And I want every legal vote counted We want openness and transparency  no secret count rooms no mystery ballots no illegal votes being cast after Election DayYou have Election Day and the laws are very strong on that You have an Election Day And they dont want votes cast after Election Day and they want the process to be an honest one Its so important We want an honest election and we want an honest count and we want honest people working back there because its a very important jobSo thats the way this country is going to win Thats the way the United States will win And we think we will win the election very easily We think theres going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence so much proof And its going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land Well see But we think therell be a lot of litigation because we cant have an election stolen by  like thisAnd I  I tell you I would  I have been talking about this for many months with all of you And Ive said very strongly that mailin ballots are going to end up being a disaster Small elections were a disaster Small very easytohandle elections were disastrousThis is a largescale version and its getting worse and worse every day Were hearing stories that are horror stories  absolute horror stories And we cant let that happen to the United States of America Its not a question of who wins  Republican Democrat Joe myself We cant let that happen to our country We cant be disgraced by having something like this happenSo it will be hopefully cleared up maybe soon I hope soon But itll probably go through a process  a legal process And as you know Ive claimed certain states and hes claiming states So we can both claim the states but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule But theres been a lot of shenanigans and we cant stand for that in our countryThank you very much

This is the 34th time Ill speak to you from the Oval Office and the last Weve been together eight years now and soon itll be time for me to go But before I do I wanted to share some thoughts some of which Ive been saving for a long timeIts been the honor of my life to be your President So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks but I could say as much to you Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serveOne of the things about the Presidency is that youre always somewhat apart You spent a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving and seeing the people through tinted glassthe parents holding up a child and the wave you saw too late and couldnt return And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass and connect Well maybe I can do a little of that tonightPeople ask how I feel about leaving And the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom The sorrowthe goodbyes of course and leaving this beautiful placeYou know down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the President and his family live There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial But on mornings when the humidity is low you can see past the Jefferson to the river the Potomac and the Virginia shore Someone said thats the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run I see more prosaic things the grass on the banks the morning traffic as people make their way to work now and then a sailboat on the riverIve been thinking a bit at that window Ive been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical onea small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor It was back in the early 80s at the height of the boat people And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway which was patrolling the South China Sea The sailor like most American servicemen was young smart and fiercely observant The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat And crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas one spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called out to him He yelled Hello American sailor Hello freedom manA small moment with a big meaning a moment the sailor who wrote it in a letter couldnt get out of his mind And when I saw it neither could I Because thats what it was to be an American in the 1980s We stood again for freedom I know we always have but in the past few years the world againand in a way we ourselvesrediscovered itIts been quite a journey this decade and we held together through some stormy seas And at the end together we are reaching our destinationThe fact is from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits from the recession of 81 to 82 to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this day weve made a difference The way I see it there were two great triumphs two things that Im proudest of One is the economic recovery in which the people of America createdand filled19 million new jobs The other is the recovery of our morale America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadershipSomething that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this It was back in 1981 and I was attending my first big economic summit which was held that year in Canada The meeting place rotates among the member countries The opening meeting was a formal dinner of the heads of goverment of the seven industrialized nations Now I sat there like the new kid in school and listened and it was all Francois this and Helmut that They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a firstname basis Well at one point I sort of leaned in and said My names Ron Well in that same year we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comebackcut taxes and regulation started to cut spending And soon the recovery beganTwo years later another economic summit with pretty much the same cast At the big opening meeting we all got together and all of a sudden just for a moment I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me And then one of them broke the silence Tell us about the American miracle he saidWell back in 1980 when I was running for President it was all so different Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe Our views on foreign affairs would cause war Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse I even remember one highly respected economist saying back in 1982 that The engines of economic growth have shut down here and theyre likely to stay that way for years to come Well he and the other opinion leaders were wrong The fact is what they call radical was really right What they called dangerous was just desperately neededAnd in all of that time I won a nickname The Great Communicator But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference it was the content I wasnt a great communicator but I communicated great things and they didnt spring full bloom from my brow they came from the heart of a great nationfrom our experience our wisdom and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries They called it the Reagan revolution Well Ill accept that but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery a rediscovery of our values and our common senseCommon sense told us that when you put a big tax on something the people will produce less of it So we cut the peoples tax rates and the people produced more than ever before The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history real family income up the poverty rate down entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new technology Were exporting more than ever because American industry because more competitive and at the same time we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at homeCommon sense also told us that to preserve the peace wed have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion So we rebuilt our defenses and this New Year we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weaponsand hope for even more progress is brightbut the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia and an Americanmediated accord will soon send 50000 Cuban troops home from AngolaThe lesson of all this was of course that because were a great nation our challenges seem complex It will always be this way But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves the future will always be ours And something else we learned Once you begin a great movement theres no telling where it will end We meant to change a nation and instead we changed a worldCountries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past For them the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold the moral way of government is the practical way of government Democracy the profoundly good is also the profoundly productiveWhen youve got to the point when you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes review your life and see it flowing before you For me there was a fork in the river and it was right in the middle of my life I never meant to go into politics It wasnt my intention when I was young But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you I was happy with my career in the entertainment world but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something preciousOurs was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government and with three little words We the People We the People tell the government what to do it doesnt tell us We the People are the driver the government is the car And we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast Almost all the worlds constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are Our Constitution is a document in which We the People tell the government what it is allowed to do We the People are free This belief has been the underlying basis for everything Ive tried to do these past eight yearsBut back in the 1960s when I began it seemed to me that wed begun reversing the order of thingsthat through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes the government was taking more of our money more of our options and more of our freedom I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say Stop I was a citizen politician and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to doI think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited Theres a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics As government expands liberty contractsNothing is less free than pure Communismand yet we have the past few years forged a satisfying new closeness with the Soviet Union Ive been asked if this isnt a gamble and my answer is no because were basing our actions not on words but deeds The detente of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises Theyd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better But the gulag was still the gulag and the state was still expansionist and they still waged proxy wars in Africa Asia and Latin AmericaWell this time so far its different President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan He has also freed prisoners whose names Ive given him every time weve metBut life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents Once during the heady days of the Moscow summit Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Streetthats a little street just off Moscows main shopping area Even though our visit was a surprise every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands We were just about swept away by the warmth You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy But within seconds a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd It was an interesting moment It reminded me that while the man on the street in the Soviet Union yearns for peace the government is Communist And those who run it are Communists and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differentlyWe must keep up our guard but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them We wish him well And well continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one What it all boils down to is this I want the new closeness to continue And it will as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner If and when they dont at first pull your punches If they persist pull the plug Its still trust but verify Its still play but cut the cards Its still watch closely And dont be afraid to see what you seeIve been asked if I have any regrets Well I do The deficit is one Ive been talking a great deal about that lately but tonight isnt for arguments and Im going to hold my tongue But an observation Ive had my share of victories in the Congress but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didnt win for me They never saw my troops they never saw Reagans regiments the American people You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action Well action is still needed If were to finish the job Reagans regiments will have to become the Bush brigades Soon hell be the chief and hell need you every bit as much as I didFinally there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells and Ive got one thats been on my mind for some time But oddly enough it starts with one of the things Im proudest of in the past eight years the resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism This national feeling is good but it wont count for much and it wont last unless its grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledgeAn informed patriotism is what we want And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America We were taught very directly what it means to be an American And we absorbed almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions If you didnt get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special TV was like that too through the mid60sBut now were about to enter the 90s and some things have changed Younger parents arent sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children And as for those who create the popular culture wellgrounded patriotism is no longer the style Our spirit is back but we havent reinstitutionalized it Weve got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedomfreedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise And freedom is special and rare Its fragile it needs production protectionSo weve got to teach history based not on whats in fashion but whats importantwhy the Pilgrims came here who Jimmy Doolittle was and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant You know four years ago on the 40th anniversary of DDay I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father whod fought on Omaha Beach Her name was Lisa Zanatta Henn and she said we will always remember we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did Well lets help her keep her word If we forget what we did we wont know who we are Im warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit Lets start with some basics more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritualAnd let me offer lesson number one about America All great change in America begins at the dinner table So tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins And children if your parents havent been teaching you what it means to be an American let em know and nail em on it That would be a very American thing to doAnd thats about all I have to say tonight except for one thing The past few days when Ive been at that window upstairs Ive thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill The phrase comes from John Winthrop who wrote it to describe the America he imagined What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim an early freedom man He journeyed here on what today wed call a little wooden boat and like the other Pilgrims he was looking for a home that would be free Ive spoken of the shining city all my political life but I dont know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans windswept Godblessed and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity And if there had to be city walls the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here Thats how I saw it and see it stillAnd how stands the city on this winter night More prosperous more secure and happier than it was eight years ago But more than that After 200 years two centuries she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge and her glow has held steady no matter what storm And shes still a beacon still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward homeWeve done our part And as I walk off into the city streets a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back My friends We did it We werent just marking time We made a difference We made the city stronger we made the city freer and we left her in good hands All in all not bad not bad at allAnd so goodbye God bless you and God bless the United States of America
Thank you very much thank you Please be seatedThose who live today remember those who do not Those who know freedom remember today those who gave up life for freedom Today in honor of the dead we conduct ceremonies We lay wreaths We speak words of tribute And in our memories in our hearts we hold them close to us still Yet we also know even as their families knew when they last looked upon them that they can never be fully ours again that they belong now to God and to that for which they so selflessly made a final and eternal act of devotionWe could not forget them Even if they were not our own we could not forget them For all time they are what we can only aspire to be giving unselfish the epitome of human loveto lay down ones life so that others might live We think on their lives We think on their final moments In our minds eye we see young Americans in a European forest or on an Asian island or at sea or in aerial combat And as life expired we know that those who could had last thoughts of us and of their love for us As they thought of us then so too we think of them now with love with devotion and with faith the certainty that what they died for was worthy of their sacrificefaith too in God and in the Nation that has pledged itself to His work and to the dream of human freedom and a nation too that today and always pledges itself to their eternal memoryThank you God bless you
Mr President Mr General Secretary distinguished delegates Half a world away from this place of peace the firing the killing the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the first time in recent memory diminished After adding terrible new names to the roll call of human horrornames such as Halabja Maidan Shahr and Spin Buldakthere is today hope of peace in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan So too in the highlands and coastal cities of southern Africaplaces of civil war places of occupation by foreign troopstalk of peace is heard peace for the tortured nation of AngolaSixtyfive hundred miles east in the Southeast Asian country of Cambodia there is hope now of a settlementthe removal of Vietnams occupying forces And finally in this hemisphere where only 12 years ago onethird of the people of Latin America lived under democratic rule some 90 percent do so today and especially in Central America nations such as El Salvador once threatened by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of totalitarian rule now know the hope of selfgovernment and the prospect of economic growthAnd another change Mr SecretaryGeneral a change that if it endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history a change that is a cause for shaking of the head in wonder is also upon usa change going to the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world warFor the first time the differences between East and Westfundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control people or people control governments for the first time these differences have shown signs of easing easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places like Afghanistan but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of press of assembly and of religionYes fundamental differences remain But should talk of reform become more than that should it become reality there is the prospect of not only a new era in SovietAmerican relations but a new age of world peace For such reform can bring peace history teaches And my country has always believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined war is a distant prospect For it is not people who make war only governments do thatI stand at this podium then in a moment of hopehope not just for the peoples of the United States or the Soviet Union but for all the peoples of the worldand hope too for the dream of peace among nations the dream that began the United NationsPrecisely because of these changes today the United Nations has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before Already you Mr SecretaryGeneral through your persistence patience and unyielding will have shown in working toward peace in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf how valuable the United Nations can be And we salute you for these accomplishmentsIn Geneva at this very hour there are numerous negotiations underwaymultilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the Soviets and ourselves And these negotiations some of them under UN auspices involve a broad arms control agendastrategic offensive weapons and space nuclear testing and chemical warfarewhose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days And Mr SecretaryGeneral the negotiators are busy And over the last few years theyve been engaged in more than an academic exercise There is movement The logjam is broken Only recently when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the INF agreement an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history Progress continues on negotiations to reduce in massive number strategic weapons with effective verification And talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in EuropeMuch of the reason for all of this goes back I believe to Geneva itself to the small chateau along the lake where I and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union had the first of several fireside chats exchanges characterized by frankness but friendliness too I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start world war III or to begin a new age of peace among nations And I also said peace conferences arms negotiations proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper underlying differences between us I said to Mr Gorbachev then as Ive said to you before Nations do not mistrust each other because theyre armed theyre armed because they mistrust each otherAnd in that place by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland Mr Gorbachev and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arms control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differencesan agenda of human rights regional conflicts and bilateral exchanges between our peoples Even on the arms control issue itself we agreed to go beyond the past to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weaponsWhat was begun that morning in Geneva has shown resultsin the INF treaty in my recent visit to Moscow in my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights and to speak too in the Lenin Hills of Moscow to the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and splendor of human freedom The results of that morning in Geneva are seen in peace conferences now underway around the world on regional conflicts and in the work of the UN here in New York as well as in GenevaBut Mr SecretaryGeneral history teaches caution Indeed that very building in Geneva where important negotiations have taken placethe Geneva accords on Afghanistan the IranIraq negotiations for examplewe see it today as stonelike testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the League of Nations an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war And yet todaythat institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War ended because the chance for peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of the world ended because humanity didnt find the courage to isolate the aggressors to reject schemes of government that serve the state not the peopleWe are here today Mr SecretaryGeneral determined that no such fate shall befall the United Nations We are determined that the UN should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind So Mr SecretaryGeneral we realize that even in this time of hope the chance of failure is real But this knowledge does not discourage us it spurs us on For the stakes are high Do we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution and see to it that at last freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer and that this place this floor shall be truly the worlds last battlefield We are determined it shall be so So we turn now to the agenda of peaceLet us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr Gorbachev in the Kremlin as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens that I met in Moscow It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this Assembly who this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one foundationobserving the inalienable rights of all members of the human family In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of state policya history it has been said of blood stupidity and barbed wire few can wonder why peace has proved so elusiveNow let us understand If we would have peace we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings In our own land and in other lands if we would have peace the trampling of the human spirit must cease Human rights is not for some some of the time Human rights as the universal declaration of this Assembly adopted in 1948 proclaims is for all people and all nations and for all timeThis regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the UN Those who starve in Ethiopia those who die among the Kurds those who face racial injustice in South Africa those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union those who cannot worship in the Ukraine those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea those who cannot publish or assemble in Managuaall of this is more than just an agenda item on your calendar It must be a first concern an issue above others For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the United Nations when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms then the very credibility of this organization is at stake the very purpose of its existence in questionThat is why when human rights progress is made the United Nations grows strongerand the United States is glad of it Following a 2year effort led by the United States for example the UN Human Rights Commission took a major step toward ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past For years Cuba a blatant violator of its citizens human rights has escaped UN censure or even scrutiny This year Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Human Rights Commission by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political prisoners improve prison conditions and tolerate the existence of a small independent national human rights groupMore must be done The United Nations must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change in Cuba and elsewhere And we must also see to it that the Universal Declaration itself should not be debased with episodes like the zionism is racism resolution Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body the most elementary obligation of its members Indeed wherever one turns in the world today there is new awareness a growing passion for human rights The people of the world grow united new groups new coalitions formcoalitions that monitor government that work against discrimination that fight religious or political repression unlawful imprisonment torture or execution As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June such movements make a differenceTurning now to regional conflicts we feel again the uplift of hope In the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War II we have a ceasefire The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace So too the Security Councils decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful Gulf Let this wara war in which there has been no victor or vanquished only victimslet this war end now Let both Iran and Iraq cooperate with the SecretaryGeneral and the Security Council in implementing Resolution 598 Let peace comeMoving on to a second region When I first addressed the UN General Assembly in 1983 world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan After nearly 9 long years of war the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway and today an end to the occupation is in sight On April 14 the USSR signed the Geneva accords which were negotiated under UN auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime We encourage the Soviet Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interferenceIn southern Africa too years of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek selfdetermination are having their effect We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola Cuba and South Africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops primarily Cuban from Angola We look forward as well to full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within AngolaMr SecretaryGeneral there are new hopes for Cambodia a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative governmenta government that will at last respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borneIn other critical areas we applaud the SecretaryGenerals efforts to structure a referendum on the western Sahara And in the Mediterranean direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation And finally we look to a peaceful solution to the ArabIsraeli conflict So too the unnatural division of Europe remains a critical obstacle to SovietAmerican relationsIn most of these areas then we see progress and again were glad of it Only a few years ago all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control Indeed the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent will among democratic and peaceloving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic a climate the world has not seen since the 1930s Only this time larger war was avoided avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will And now the United Nations is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recedeAnd because were resolved to keep it so I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international communityThis elite in calling itself revolutionary seeks no real revolution the use of the term is subterfuge deception for hiding the oldest most corrupt vice of all mans ageold will to power his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others And thats why as President I will continue to urge the Congress and the American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regimes aggression against its neighbors in Central AmericaToday I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflictsto assist in bringing conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime a regime whose goals of regional domination while ultimately doomed can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to SovietAmerican relations unless action is taken nowMoving now to the arms reduction agenda I have mentioned already the importance of the INF treaty and the momentum developed in the START negotiations The draft START treaty is a lengthy document filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides But through this summer in Geneva those brackets have diminished There is every reason to believe this process can continue I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months but I can tell you a year from now is a possibilitymore than a possibility But we have no deadline No agreement is better than a bad agreement The United States remains hopeful and we acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the Soviet Union in these negotiations We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreementsSo too our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and space have been useful But let me here stress to this General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control negotiations is due to technological progress itself especially in the potential for spacebased defensive systems I believe that the United States determination to research and develop and when ready deploy such defensive systemssystems targeted to destroy missiles not peopleaccounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in GenevaWith such systems for the first time in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere major powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner choice to shield against an attack instead of avenging it So too as defensive systems grow in effectiveness they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals Only recently briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought Today the United States reaffirms its commitment to its Strategic Defense Initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with othersAnd yet even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror weve lived under in the postwar era even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world a terror we thought the world had put behind a terror that looms at us now from the longburied past from ghostly scarring trenches and the haunting wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time poison gas chemical warfare Mr SecretaryGeneral distinguished delegates the terror of it The horror of it We condemn it The use of chemical weapons in the IranIraq war beyond its tragic human toll jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since World War ILet this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons I call upon the signatories to that protocol as well as other concerned states to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty And we urge all nations to cooperate in negotiating a verifiable truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban once and for all and on a verifiable and global basis the use of chemical and gas warfareFinally Mr SecretaryGeneral we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world Likewise proliferation in other hightechnology weapons such as ballistic missiles is reaching global proportions exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze Talks between American and Soviet experts begin on this today And we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East become even more deadly battlegrounds than they already areBut in most of these areas we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like this United Nations That is why now more than ever the United Nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and program reform The UN already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions budgeting by consensus and the establishment of program priorities These actions are extremely important The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions I expect the reform program will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal yearAnd let me say here we congratulate the United Nations on the work it has done in three areas of special concern First our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and statesponsored terrorism must continue And we must also end the scourge of hostage taking Second the work of the World Health Organization in coordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital All international efforts in this area must be redoubled The AIDS crisis is a grave one We must move as one to meet itAnd so too is the drug crisis Were moving now toward a new antidrugtrafficking convention This important treaty will be completed in December I am confident other strong UN drug control programs will also follow The American people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered We will not tolerate the drug traffickers We mean to make war on them and we believe this is one war the United Nations can endorse and participate inYes the United Nations is a better place than it was 8 years ago and so too is the world But the real issue of reform in the United Nations is not limited just to fiscal and administrative improvements but also to a higher sort of reform an intellectual and philosophical reform a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the stateFew developments for example have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session this body held on Africa 2 12 years ago a session in which the United Nations joined as one in a call for freemarket incentives and a lessening of state controls to spur economic development At one of the first international assemblies of my Presidency in Cancun Mexico I said history demonstrates that time and again in place after place economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom that individual farmers laborers owners traders and managers are the heart and soul of development Trust them because where theyre allowed to create and build where theyre given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success then societies become more dynamic prosperous progressive and free We believe in freedom We know it worksAnd this Mr SecretaryGeneral and distinguished delegates is the immutable lesson of the postwar era that freedom workseven more that freedom and peace work together Every year that passes everywhere in the world this lesson is taking hold from the Peoples Republic of China to Cameroon from Bolivia to Botswana and yes in the citadel of MarxismLeninism itself No my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom but believe me we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience with it Free people blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual are not driven toward war or the domination of others Here then is the way to world peaceAnd yet we Americans champion freedom not only because its practical and beneficial but because it is also just morally right And here Mr SecretaryGeneral I hope youll permit me to note that I have addressed this assemblage more than any of my predecessors and that this will be the last occasion I do so So I hope too I may be permitted now some closing reflectionsThe world is currently witnessing another celebration of international cooperation At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports and we see young people who know precious little of the resentments of their elders coming together as one One of our young athletes from a home of modest means said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth We were rich as a family she said about the love she was given and the values she was taught Mr SecretaryGeneral I dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values values such as family the first and most important unit of society where all values and learning beginan institution to be cherished and protected values too such as work community freedom and faith For its here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peaceAnd our own experience on this continentthe American experiencethough brief has had one unmistakable encounter an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth It is a truth that our first President our Founding Father passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people It is a truth that I hope now youll permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence that the case for inalienable rights that the idea of human dignity that the notion of conscience above compulsion can be made only in the context of higher law only in the context of what one of the founders of this organization SecretaryGeneral Dag Hammarskjold has called devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves This is the endless cycle the final truth to which humankind seems always to return that religion and morality that faith in something higher are prerequisites for freedom and that justice and peace within ourselves is the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the agesYes this is a place of great debate and grave discussions And yet I cannot help but note here that one of our Founding Fathers the most worldly of men an internationalist Benjamin Franklin interrupted the proceedings of our own Constitutional Convention to make much the same point And I cannot help but think this morning of other beginnings of where and when I first read those words And they shall beat their swords into plowshares   and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams    This morning my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life but her most important gift was the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gained in prayer Its the greatest help Ive had in my Presidency and I recall here Lincolns words when he said only the most foolish of men would think he could confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone stronger a power above all othersI think then of her and others like her in that small town in Illinois gentle people who possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to prize No one of them could ever have imagined the boy from the banks of the Rock River would come to this moment and have this opportunity But had they been told it would happen I think they would have been a bit disappointed if Id not spoken here for what they knew so well that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles when our faith in humanity falters it is then that we must seek comfort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom one greater than ourselvesAnd so if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice it will be cause for pride But it shall be a cause of greater pride still if it is also said that we were wise enough to know the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but overture that the truly majestic musicthe music of freedom of justice and peaceis the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made usThank you for your hospitality over the years I bid you now farewell and God bless you
Madam Chairman delegates to the convention and fellow citizensThank you for that warm and generous welcome Nancy and I have been enjoying the finest of Southern hospitality since we arrived here yesterday And believe me after that reception I dont think the Big Easy has ever been bigger than it has tonight And with all due respect to Cajun cuisine cooking and New Orleans jazz nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this hall except maybe a victory celebration on November 8th In that spirit I think we can be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for having made Republican a proud word once again and America a proud nation again Nancy and I are so honored to be your guests tonight to share a little of your special time and we thank youNow I want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment about a very special lady who has been selfless not just for our party but for the entire Nation She is a strong courageous compassionate woman and wherever shes gone here in the United States as well as abroad whether with young or old whether comforting the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the scourge of drugs she makes us proud Ive been proud of her for a long time but never more so than in these last 8 years With your tribute to Nancy today you warmed my heart as well as hers and believe me she deserves your tribute And I am deeply grateful to you for what you have doneWhen people tell me that I became President on January 20th 1981 I feel I have to correct them You dont become President of the United States You are given temporary custody of an institution called the Presidency which belongs to our people Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure That trust began with many of you in this room many conventions ago Manys the time that Ive said a prayer of thanks to all Americans who placed this trust in my hands And tonight please accept again our heartfelt gratitude Nancys and mine for this special time that youve given in our livesJust a moment ago you multiplied the honor with a moving tribute and being only human theres a part of me that would like to take credit for what weve achieved But tonight before we do anything else let us remember that tribute really belongs to the 245 million citizens who make up the greatestand the firstthree words in our Constitution We the People It is the American people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of national calamity renewing our mighty economic strength and leading the way to restoring our respect in the world They are an extraordinary breed we call Americans So if theres any salute deserved tonight its to the heroes everywhere in this land who make up the doers the dreamers and the lifebuilders without which our glorious experiment in democracy would have failedThis convention brings back so many memories to a fellow like me I can still remember my first Republican convention Abraham Lincoln giving a speech that laughter sent tingles down my spine No I have to confess I wasnt actually there The truth is way back then I belonged to the other party  But surely we can remember another convention Eight years ago we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams When I look back I wonder if we dared be  so bold to take on those burdens But in that same city of Detroit when the 20th century was only in its second year another great Republican Teddy Roosevelt told Americans not to hold back from dangers ahead but to rejoice Our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our children it shall be given to make this Republic the mightiest among the peoples of mankind Teddy said those years ago In 1980 we needed every bit of that kind of faithThat year it was our dream that together we could rescue America and make a new beginning to create anew that shining city on a hill The dream we shared was to reclaim our government to transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny We made a determination that our dream would not be built on a foundation of sandsomething called Trust Me Governmentbut we would trust instead the American spirit And yes we were unashamed in believing that this dream was driven by a community of shared values of family work neighborhood peace and freedom And on the night of July 17th 1980 we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make America great again We had faith because the heroes in our midst had never failed us before Tom Paine knew what these Americans with character of steel could do when he wrote The harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph And my fellow citizens while our triumph is not yet complete the road has been glorious indeedEight years ago we met at a time when America was in economic chaos and today we meet in a time of economic promise We met then in international distress and today with global hope Now I think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review of that history tonightas the saying goes just a friendly reminder Ive been doing a little remembering of my own because of all that inflated rhetoric by our friends in Atlanta last month But then inflation is their specialtyBefore we came to Washington Americans had just suffered the two worst backtoback years of inflation in 60 years Those are the facts and as John Adams said Facts are stubborn things Interest rates had jumped to over 21 percent the highest in 120 years more than doubling the average monthly mortgage payments for working familiesour families When they sat around the kitchen table it was not to plan summer vacations it was to plan economic survival Facts are stubborn thingsIndustrial production was down and productivity was down for 2 consecutive years The average weeklyyou missed me The President referred to a background noise  The average weekly wage plunged 9 percent The median family income fell 512 percent Facts are stubborn thingsOur friends on the other side had actually passed the single highest tax bill in the 200year history of the United States Auto loans because of their policies went up to 17 percent so our great factories began shutting down Fuel costs jumped through the atmosphere more than doubling Then people waited in gas lines as well as unemployment lines Facts are stupid thingsstubborn things I should say And then there was the misery index That was an election year gimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign They added the unemployment and inflation rates And it came to 134 percent in 1976 and they declared that our candidate Jerry Ford had no right to seek reelection with that kind of misery index But 4 years later in the 1980 campaign they didnt mention the misery index Do you suppose it was because it was no longer 134 percent In those 4 years it had become almost 21 percent And last month in Atlanta at their convention there was again no mention of the misery index Why Because right now its less than 92 percent Facts are stubborn thingsWhen we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 it was a summer of discontent for America around the world Our national defense had been so weakened the Soviet Union had begun to engage in reckless aggression including the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan The US response to that was to forbid our athletes to participate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the rug out from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo And in those years on any given day we had military aircraft that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts and ships that couldnt leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew Our Embassy in Pakistan was burned to the ground and the one in Iran was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages The world began to question the constancy and resolve of the United States Our leaders answered not that there was something wrong with our government but that our people were at fault because of some malaise Well facts are stubborn thingsWhen our friends last month talked of unemployment despair hopelessness economic weakness I wondered why on Earth they were talking about 1978 instead of 1988And now we hear talk that its time for a change Well ladies and gentlemen another friendly reminder We are the change We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981 We focused on hope not despair We challenged the failed policies of the past because we believed that a society is great not because of promises made by its government but only because of progress made by its people And that was our changeWe said something shocking Taxes ought to be reduced not raised We cut the tax rates for the working folks of America We indexed taxes and that stopped a bracket creep which kicked average wage earners into higher tax brackets when they had only received a costofliving pay raise And we initiated reform of the unfairness in our tax system And what do you know the top 5 percent of earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at the lower rates than they ever had before and millions of earners at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income tax at all That was our changeSo together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 1712 million good jobs Thats more than a quarter of a million new jobs a monthevery monthfor 68 consecutive months America is working again And just since our 1984 convention we have created over 11 million of those new jobs Now just why would our friends on the other side want to change that Why do they think putting you out of work is better than putting you to workNew homes are being built New car sales reached record levels Exports are starting to climb again Factory capacity is approaching maximum use You know Ive noticed they dont call it Reaganomics anymore As for inflation well that too has changed We changed it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 down to between 35 and 4 percent Interest rates are less than half of what they were In fact nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family homes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actually old loans being refinanced at the new lower rates Young families have finally been able to get some relief These too were our changesWe rebuilt our Armed Forces We liberated Grenada from the Communists and helped return that island to democracy We struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism Weve seen the growth of democracy in 90 percent of Latin America The Soviets have begun to pull out of Afghanistan The bloody IranIraq war is coming to an end And for the first time in 8 years we have the prospects of peace in Southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and other foreign forces from the region And in the 2765 days of our administration not i inch of ground has fallen to the CommunistsThe President Today we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles Were working on the Strategic Defense Initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror And American and Soviet relations are the best theyve ever been since World War IIAnd virtually all this change occurredand continues to occurin spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that its time for a change They resisted our defense buildup They resisted our tax cuts They resisted cutting the fat out of government And they resisted our appointments of judges committed to the law and the ConstitutionAnd its time for some more straight talk This time its about the budget deficit Yes its much too high But the President doesnt vote for a budget and the President cant spend a dime Only the Congress can do that They blame the defense increases for the deficit yet defense spending today in real dollars is almost exactly what it was 6 years ago In a 6year period Congress cut defense spending authority by over 125 billion And for every 1 reduction in defense outlays they added 2 to domestic spendingNow if they had passed my first budget my first spending plan in 1982 the cumulative outlays and deficits would have been 207 billion lower by 1986 Every single year Ive been in office I have supported and called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and the liberals have said no every year I called for the lineitem veto which 43 Governors have to cut fat in the budget and the liberals have said no Every year Ive attempted to limit their wild spending sprees and theyve said no They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in 1981 when we took office Well let me tell you something The fact is when they began their war on poverty in the middle sixties from 1965 through 1980m just those 15 years the budgets increased to five times what they had been and the deficits went up to 52 times what they had been before their war on poverty Now dont we know that if theyre elected their answer will be the one theyve relied on in the past and that is higher taxesThe other party has controlled the House of Representatives for 52 out of the last 56 yearsTheyve controlled the Senate also for 46 of those yearsWhere we really need a change is to elect Republican majorities in both Houses And then George Bush can have a team that will protect your tax cuts keep America strong hold down inflation and interest rates appoint judges to preserve your rights and yes reduce the budget deficitEarly in the first term we set out to reduce Federal regulations that had been imposed on the people on businesses and on local and State governments Today Im proud to say that we have eliminated so many unnecessary regulations that governmentrequired paperwork imposed on citizens businesses and other levels of government has been reduced by an estimated 600 million manhours of paperwork a year And George was thereNo you havent heard it all yet George Bush headed up that task force that eliminated those regulationsIn 1980 and before it took 7 weeks to get a Social Security card Now it takes 10 days It only takes 10 days to get a passport It used to take 43 days It took 75 days to get an export license Now its only 17 days and for some countries only 5 It took over 100 days to process a claim for a Department of Housing and Urban Development Title I loan100 days It now takes less than onefourth of that22 days I think these specifics suggest there is a new level of competent management in the Departments of our government George played a major role in everything that we have accomplished in these 8 yearsNow early on we had a foreign policy problem Our NATO allies were under the threat of Soviet intermediaterange missiles and NATO had no equivalent deterrent Our effort to provide a deterrentPershing and groundlaunched cruise missiles on the NATO lineresulted in political problems for our NATO allies There was objection on the part of many other people to deployment of our missiles George represented us in Brussels with the heads of the NATO countries and they agreed when he finished to take the missiles This subsequently persuaded the Soviets to sign the INF treaty and begin removing their SS20sNone of our achievements happened by accident but only because we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place And without George Bush to build on those policies everything weve achieved will be at risk All the work sacrifice and effort of the American people could end in the very same disaster that we inherited in 1981Because I feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect our gains for the American family and for national security I want to share with you the qualities we should seek in the next President We need someone whos big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with Mr Gorbachev because this is no time to gamble with onthejob training We need someone whos prepared to be President and who has the commitment to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong Itll take somebody who has seen this office from the inside who senses the danger points will be cool under fire and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come Well thats the George Bush that Ive seen up close when the staff and Cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are alonesomeone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue someone who never runs away from a fight never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excusesThis office is not mine to give only you the people can do that But I love America too much and care too much about where we will be in the next few years I care that we give custody of this office to someone who will build on our changes not retreat to the past someone who will continue the change all of us fought for To preserve what we have and not risk losing it all America needs George Bushand Barbara Bush as First LadyOkay All rightWith George Bush Ill know as we approach the new millennium our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression Well have a prosperity that spreads the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all America Well have safe and active neighborhoods drugfree schools that send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep values and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership into the uncharted reaches of a new ageSo George Im in your corner Im ready to volunteer a little advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy if asked Ill help keep the facts straight or just stand back and cheer But George just one personal request Go out there and win one for the GipperAs you can imagine Im sorely tempted to spend the rest of this evening telling the truth about our friends who met in Atlanta but then why should I have all the fun  So for the next few moments lets talk about the futureThis is the last Republican convention I will address as President Maybe youll see your way to inviting me back sometime But like so many of us as I said earlier I started out in the other party But 40 years ago I cast my last vote as a Democrat It was a party in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised the return of power to the States It was a party where Harry Truman committed a strong and resolute America to preserving freedom FDR had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local governments and to the States That party changed and it will never be the same They left me I didnt leave them So it was our Republican Party that gave me a political home When I signed up for duty I didnt have to check my principles at the door And I soon found out that the desire for victory did not overcome our devotion to idealsAnd what ideals those have been Our party speaks for human freedom for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence We do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions We believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the good will of our adversaries We have a healthy skepticism of government checking its excesses at the same time were willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens We have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of the Federal Government We dont think that inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor the young and the elderly We respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation For our children we dont think its wrong to have them committed to pledging each day to the one nation under God indivisible  with liberty and justice for all And we have so many requirements in their classrooms why cant we at least have one thing that is voluntary and that is allow our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start the day as Congress does For the unborn quite simply shouldnt they be able to live to become children in those classroomsThose are some of our principles You in this room and millions like you watching and listening tonight are selfless and dedicated to a better world based on these principles You arent quitters You walk not just precincts but for a cause You stand for somethingthe finest warriors for free government that I have known Nancy and I thank you for letting us be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world for our children And thats why were here isnt it A better worldI know Ive said this before but I believe that God put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love for freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world Its our gift to have visions and I want to share that of a young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took office In his letter he said I love America because you can join Cub Scouts if you want to You have a right to worship as you please If you have the ability you can try to be anything you want to be And I also like America because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream Well truth through the eyes of a child freedom of association freedom of worship freedom of hope and opportunity and the pursuit of happinessin this case choosing among 200 flavors of ice creamthats America everyone with his or her vision of the American promise Thats why were a magnet for the world for those who dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over the Berlin Wall and others only a few of whom avoided death coming in tiny boats on turbulent oceans This land its people the dreams that unfold here and the freedom to bring it all togetherwell those are what make America soar up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom windsWhen our children turn the pages of our lives I hope theyll see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could where theres decency tolerance generosity honesty courage common sense fairness and piety This is my vision and Im grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a long one But when I pack up my bags in Washington dont expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my lifeTwilight Twilight Not in America Here its a sunrise every day fresh new opportunities dreams to build Twilight Thats not possible because I confess there are times when I feel like Im still little Dutch Reagan racing my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the Rock River You see theres no sweeter day than each new one because here in our country it means something wonderful can happen to you And something wonderful happened to meWe lit a prairie fire a few years back Those flames were fed by passionate ideas and convictions and we were determined to make them run allburn I should say all across America And what times weve had Together weve fought for causes we love But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight because the battle is never over Our freedom must be defended over and over againand then againTheres still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch fences that need repair and horses to ride But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim Ill leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier Just let me know and Ill be there as long as words dont leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be special during its shining moment on EarthTwilight you say Listen to HG Wells HG Wells says The past is but the beginning of a beginning and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn Well thats a new dayour sunlit new dayto keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing we can say that we did all that could be donenever lessThank you Good night God bless you and God bless America
Thank you Rector Logunov and I want to thank all of you very much for a very warm welcome Its a great pleasure to be here at Moscow State University and I want to thank you all for turning out I know you must be very busy this week studying and taking your final examinations So let me just say zhelayu yam uspekha I wish you success Nancy couldnt make it today because shes visiting Leningrad which she tells me is a very beautiful city but she too says hello and wishes you all good luckLet me say its also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union Before I left Washington I received many heartfelt letters and telegrams asking me to carry here a simple message perhaps but also some of the most important business of this summit It is a message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoplesAs you know Ive come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates In this our fourth summit General Secretary Gorbachev and I have spent many hours together and I feel that were getting to know each other well Our discussions of course have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of the day issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments But first I want to take a little time to talk to you much as I would to any group of university students in the United States I want to talk not just of the realities of today but of the possibilities of tomorrowStanding here before a mural of your revolution I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict Its effects are peaceful but they will fundamentally alter our world shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives Its easy to underestimate because its not accompanied by banners or fanfare Its been called the technological or information revolution and as its emblem one might take the tiny silicon chip no bigger than a fingerprint One of these chips has more computing power than a roomful of oldstyle computersAs part of an exchange program we now have an exhibition touring your country that shows how information technology is transforming our livesreplacing manual labor with robots forecasting weather for farmers or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical researchers These microcomputers today aid the design of everything from houses to ears to spacecraft they even design better and faster computers They can translate English into Russian or enable the blind to read or help Michael Jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra Linked by a network of satellites and fiberoptic cables one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments just a few years agoLike a chrysalis were emerging from the economy of the Industrial Revolutionan economy confined to and limited by the Earths physical resourcesinto as one economist titled his book The Economy in Mind in which there are no bounds on human imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural resource Think of that little computer chip Its value isnt in the sand from which it is made but in the microscopic architecture designed into it by ingenious human minds Or take the example of the satellite relaying this broadcast around the world which replaces thousands of tons of copper mined from the Earth and molded into wire In the new economy human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete Were breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny Even as we explore the most advanced reaches of science were returning to the ageold wisdom of our culture a wisdom contained in the book of Genesis in the Bible In the beginning was the spirit and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation issued forthBut progress is not foreordained The key is freedomfreedom of thought freedom of information freedom of communication The renowned scientist scholar and founding father of this university Mikhail Lomonosov knew that It is common knowledge he said that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy You know one of the first contacts between your country and mine took place between Russian and American explorers The Americans were members of Cooks last voyage on an expedition searching for an Arctic passage on the island of Unalaska they came upon the Russians who took them in and together with the native inhabitants held a prayer service on the iceThe explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs men with vision with the courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States They are the prime movers of the technological revolution In fact one of the largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students no older than you in the garage behind their home Some people even in my own country look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste What of all the entrepreneurs that fail Well many do particularly the successful ones often several times And if you ask them the secret of their success theyll tell you its all that they learned in their struggles along the way yes its what they learned from failing Like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth experience is the greatest teacherAnd thats why its so hard for government planners no matter how sophisticated to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true The fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world Theres an old story about a townit could be anywherewith a bureaucrat who is known to be a goodfornothing but he somehow had always hung on to power So one day in a town meeting an old woman got up and said to him There is a folk legend here where I come from that when a baby is born an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body If the angel kisses him on his hand he becomes a handyman If he kisses him on his forehead he becomes bright and clever And Ive been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world Places such as the Republic of Korea Singapore Taiwan have vaulted into the technological era barely pausing in the industrial age along the way Lowtax agricultural policies in the subcontinent mean that in some years India is now a net exporter of food Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are blowing over the Peoples Republic of China where onequarter of the worlds population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom At the same time the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age In Latin America in the 1970s only a third of the population lived under democratic government today over 90 percent does In the Philippines in the Republic of Korea free contested democratic elections are the order of the day Throughout the world free markets are the model for growth Democracy is the standard by which governments are measuredWe Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom In fact its something of a national pastime Every four years the American people choose a new President and 1988 is one of those years At one point there were 13 major candidates running in the two major parties not to mention all the others including the Socialist and Libertarian candidatesall trying to get my job About 1000 local television stations 8500 radio stations and 1700 daily newspaperseach one an independent private enterprise fiercely independent of the Governmentreport on the candidates grill them in interviews and bring them together for debates In the end the people vote they decide who will be the next President But freedom doesnt begin or end with electionsGo to any American town to take just an example and youll see dozens of churches representing many different beliefsin many places synagogues and mosquesand youll see families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together Go into any schoolroom and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rightsamong them life liberty and the pursuit of happinessthat no government can justly deny the guarantees in their Constitution for freedom of speech freedom of assembly and freedom of religion Go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent judge beholden to no government power There every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers usually 12 men and womencommon citizens they are the ones the only ones who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence In that court the accused is innocent until proven guilty and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused Go to any university campus and there youll find an open sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American society and what can be done to correct them Turn on the television and youll see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land March in any demonstration and there are many of them the peoples right of assembly is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the police Go into any union hall where the members know their right to strike is protected by law As a matter of fact one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union the Screen Actors Guild I led my union out on strike and Im proud to say we wonBut freedom is more even than this Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions It is the right to put forth an idea scoffed at by the experts and watch it catch fire among the people It is the right to dreamto follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if youre the only one in a sea of doubters Freedom is the recognition that no single person no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth but that every individual life is infinitely precious that every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offerAmerica is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling theyre ties of kinship In America youll find Russians Armenians Ukrainians peoples from Eastern Europe and Central Asia They come from every part of this vast continent from every continent to live in harmony seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives Recently a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West We can only hope that it wont be long before all are allowed to do so and UkrainianAmericans BalticAmericans ArmenianAmericans can freely visit their homelands just as this IrishAmerican visits hisFreedom it has been said makes people selfish and materialistic but Americans are one of the most religious peoples on Earth Because they know that liberty just as life itself is not earned but a gift from God they seek to share that gift with the world Reason and experience said George Washington in his farewell address both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle And it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited unintrusive a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life the true sources of value found only in family and faithBut I hope you know I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land Who after all needs to tell the land of Dostoyevsky about the quest for truth the home of Kandinsky and Scriabin about imagination the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of letters Alisher Navoi about beauty and heart The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom It comes not from the literature of America but from this country from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century Boris Pasternak in the novel Dr Zhivago He writes I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threatsany kind of threat whether of jail or of retribution after deaththen the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip not the prophet who sacrificed himself But this is just the pointwhat has for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel but an inward musicthe irresistible power of unarmed truthThe irresistible power of unarmed truth Today the world looks expectantly to signs of change steps toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union We watch and we hope as we see positive changes taking place There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity who fear to embrace the hope of the futuresometimes it takes faith Its like that scene in the cowboy movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see The posse is closing in on the two outlaws Butch and Sundance who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below but Sundance refuses He says hed rather fight it out with the posse even though theyre hopelessly outnumbered Butch says thats suicide and urges him to jump but Sundance still refuses and finally admits I cant swim Butch breaks up laughing and says You crazy fool the fall will probably kill you And by the way both Butch and Sundance made it in case you didnt see the movie I think what Ive just been talking about is perestroika and what its goals areBut change would not mean rejection of the past Like a tree growing strong through the seasons rooted in the Earth and drawing life from the sun so too positive change must be rooted in traditional valuesin the land in culture in family and communityand it must take its life from the eternal things from the source of all life which is faith Such change will lead to new understandings new opportunities to a broader future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full flowering That is the future beckoning to your generationAt the same time we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized will always be insecure Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder A bird on a tether no matter how long the rope can always be pulled back And that is why in my conversation with General Secretary Gorbachev I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize changeto put guarantees on reform And weve been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world the Berlin Wall Its time to remove the barriers that keep people apartIm proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times Mr Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985 In our discussion today we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans Words travel lighter and thats why wed like to make available to this country more of our 11000 magazines and periodicals and our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of lifeJust a few years ago few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together The INF treaty which General Secretary Gorbachev and I signed last December in Washington and whose instruments of ratification we will exchange tomorrowthe first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history calling for the elimination of an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles And just 16 days ago we saw the beginning of your withdrawal from Afghanistan which gives us hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin and that that suffering country may find selfdetermination unity and peace at long lastIts my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction and conflicts in many regions of the globe and that the serious discussions that led to the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will help lead to solutions in southern Africa Ethiopia Cambodia the Persian Gulf and Central America I have often said Nations do not distrust each other because they are armed they are armed because they distrust each other If this globe is to live in peace and prosper if it is to embrace all the possibilities of the technological revolution then nations must renounce once and for all the right to an expansionist foreign policy Peace between nations must be an enduring goal not a tactical stage in a continuing conflictIve been told that theres a popular song in your countryperhaps you know itwhose evocative refrain asks the question Do the Russians want a war In answer it says Go ask that silence lingering in the air above the birch and poplar there beneath those trees the soldiers lie Go ask my mother ask my wife then you will have to ask no more Do the Russians want a war But what of your onetime allies What of those who embraced you on the Elbe What if we were to ask the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where Americas fallen were buried far from home What if we were to ask their mothers sisters and sons do Americans want war Ask us too and youll find the same answer the same longing in every heart People do not make wars governments do And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain for economic advantage for ideology A people free to choose will always choose peaceAmericans seek always to make friends of old antagonists After a colonial revolution with Britain we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations After a terrible Civil War between North and South we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation We fought two world wars in my lifetime against Germany and one with Japan but now the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friendsSome people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of strain but theyre the frictions of all families and the family of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between America and a growing exuberant exporting Soviet Union that had opened up to economic freedom and growthAnd as important as these official peopletopeople exchanges are nothing would please me more than for them to become unnecessary to see travel between East and West become so routine that university students in the Soviet Union could take a month off in the summer and just like students in the West do now put packs on their backs and travel from country to country in Europe with barely a passport cheek in between Nothing would please me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in say England could call up a Soviet rock group without going through any government agency and have them playing in Liverpool the next night Is this just a dream Perhaps but it is a dream that is our responsibility to have come trueYour generation is living in one of the most exciting hopeful times in Soviet history It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of Gogols Dead Souls Comparing his nation to a speeding troika Gogol asks what will be its destination But he writes There was no answer save the bell pouring forth marvelous soundWe do not know what the conclusion will be of this journey but were hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled In this Moscow spring this May 1988 we may be allowed that hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over Tolstoys grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through ringing through leading to a new world of reconciliation friendship and peaceThank you all very much and da blagoslovit vas gospodGod bless youMr Logunov Dear friends Mr President has kindly agreed to answer your questions But since he doesnt have too much time only 15 minutesso those who have questions please ask themStrategic Arms ReductionsQ And this is a student from the history faculty and he says that hes happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the university And the first question is that the improvement in the relations between the two countries has come about during your tenure as President and in this regard he would like to ask the following question It is very important to get a handle on the question of arms control and specifically the limitation of strategic arms Do you think that it will be possible for you and the General Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arms during the time that you are still PresidentPresident Reagan Well the arms treaty that is being negotiated now is the socalled START treaty and it is based on taking the intercontinental ballistic missiles and reducing them by half down to parity between our two countries Now this is a much more complicated treaty than the INF treaty the intermediaterange treaty which we have signed and which our two governments have ratified and is now in effect So there are many things still to be settled You and we have had negotiators in Geneva for months working on various points of this treaty Once we had hoped that maybe like the INF treaty we would have been able to sign it here at this summit meeting It is not completed there are still some points that are being debated We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office which is in the coming January but I assure you that if it isntI assure you that I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed My dream has always been that once weve started down this road we can look forward to a dayyou can look forward to a daywhen there will be no more nuclear weapons in the world at all
Mr Speaker Mr President and distinguished Members of the House and SenateWhen we first met here seven years agomany of us for the first timeit was with the hope of beginning something new for America We meet here tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration I say lets leave that to history were not finished yet So my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes were still on the jobHistory records the power of the ideas that brought us here those 7 years agoideas like the individuals right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit the free market as an engine of economic progress And as an ancient Chinese philosopher Laotzu said Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish do not overdo it Well these ideas were part of a larger notion a vision if you will of America herselfan America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an America too of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods an America whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values the value of work of family of religion and of the love of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense He has entrusted in a special way to this nationAll of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr Gorbachev was herethe belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words We the People the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights and not the other way around And theres one lesson that has come home powerfully to me which I would offer to you now Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each other their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor so too Americas leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party but what is best for AmericaIn the spirit of Jefferson let us affirm that in this Chamber tonight there are no Republicans no Democratsjust Americans Yes we will have our differences but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us Those who sent us here to serve themthe millions of Americans watching and listening tonightexpect this of us Lets prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year Weve done this before And as we have worked together to bring down spending tax rates and inflation employment has climbed to record heights America has created more jobs and better higher paying jobs family income has risen for 4 straight years and Americas poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 yearsOur record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work incentives growth and opportunity a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77percent increase in charitable giving a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the American dreamIn international relations too theres only one description for what together we have achieved a complete turnabout a revolution Seven years ago America was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege Today America is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move From Central America to East Asia ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold Weve replaced Blame America with Look up to America Weve rebuilt our defenses And of all our accomplishments none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our countrys uniformAnd in a few moments Im going to talk about three developmentsarms reduction the Strategic Defense Initiative and the global democratic revolutionthat when taken together offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine 7 years ago a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terrorTonight then were strong prosperous at peace and we are free This is the state of our Union And if we will work together this year I believe we can give a future President and a future Congress the chance to make that prosperity that peace that freedom not just the state of our Union but the state of our worldToward this end we have four basic objectives tonight First steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment Second lets check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention I mean schools that work economic independence for the poor restoring respect for family life and family values Our third objective tonight is global continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions weve seen around the world Fourth and finally our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next President inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that President a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully fundedThis is a full agenda Its meant to be You see my thinking on the next year is quite simple Lets make this the best of 8 And that means its all outright to the finish line I dont buy the idea that this is the last year of anything because were not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes And thats why our focus is the values the principles and ideas that made America great Lets be clear on this point Were for limited government because we understand as the Founding Fathers did that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every American of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of American prosperity and freedomOne other thing we Americans likethe futurelike the sound of it the idea of it the hope of it Where others fear trade and economic growth we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamedof opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond Where others seek to throw up barriers we seek to bring them down Where others take counsel of their fears we follow our hopes Yes we Americans like the future and like making the most of it Lets do that nowAnd lets begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of Federal deficits We have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years For the first time in 14 years the Federal Government spent less in real terms last year than the year before We took 73 billion off last years deficit compared to the year before The deficit itself has moved from 63 percent of the gross national product to only 34 percent And perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits You know a few of us can remember when not too many years ago those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because we owe it to ourselves Well at last there is agreement that we cant spend ourselves richOur recent budget agreement designed to reduce Federal deficits by 76 billion over the next 2 years builds on this consensus But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past more broken promises and more unchecked spending As I indicated in my first State of the Union what ails us can be simply put The Federal Government is too big and it spends too much money I can assure you the bipartisan leadership of Congress of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement And this includes the swift and certain use of the veto powerNow its also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling Federal deficits The simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenuessomething American families do and the Federal Government canthas caused crisis after crisis in this city Mr Speaker Mr President I will say to you tonight what I have said before and will continue to say The budget process has broken down it needs a drastic overhaul With each ensuing year the spectacle before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas budget deadlines delayed or missed completely monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill and a Federal Government on the brink of defaultI know Im echoing what you here in the Congress have said because you suffered so directly But lets recall that in 7 years of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date only 10 made it on time Last year of the 13 appropriations bills due by October 1st none of them made it Instead we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days then 36 days and 2 days and 3 days respectivelyAnd then along came these behemoths This is the conference report1053 pages report weighing 14 pounds Then thisa reconciliation bill 6 months late that was 1186 pages long weighing 15 pounds And the longterm continuing resolutionthis one was 2 months late and its 1057 pages long weighing 14 pounds That was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink You had 3 hoursyes 3 hoursto consider each and it took 300 people at my Office of Management and Budget just to read the bill so the Government wouldnt shut down Congress shouldnt send another one of these No and if you do I will not sign itLets change all this Instead of a Presidential budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced why not a simple partnership a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues And lets remember our deadline is October 1st not Christmas Lets get the peoples work done in time to avoid a footrace with Santa Claus  And yes this yearto coin a phrasea new beginning 13 individual bills on time and fully reviewed by CongressIm also certain you join me in saying Lets help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the President a tool that though I will not get to use it is one I know future Presidents of either party must have Give the President the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States the right to reach into massive appropriation bills pare away the waste and enforce budget discipline Lets approve the lineitem vetoAnd lets take a partial step in this direction Most of you in this Chamber didnt know what was in this catchall bill and report Over the past few weeks weve all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there For example theres millions for items such as cranberry research blueberry research the study of crawfish and the commercialization of wildflowers And thats not to mention the five or so million 5 million thatso that people from developing nations could come here to watch Congress at work  I wont even touch that  So tonight I offer you this challenge In 30 days I will send back to you those items as rescissions which if I had the authority to line them out I would do soNow review this multibilliondollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement As a matter of fact if adopted it will improve our deficit reduction goals And what an example we can set that were serious about getting our financial accounts in order By acting and approving this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of controlThere is another vital reform Yes GrammRudmanHollings has been profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent Let us do now what so many States do to hold down spending and what 32 State legislatures have asked us to do Let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the Federal Government to live within its means Reform of the budget processincluding the lineitem veto and balanced budget amendmentwill together with real restraint on government spending prevent the Federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budgetLets ensure that the Federal Government never again legislates against the family and the home Last September I signed an Executive order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family But let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process not just in this administration but in all future administrations Its time for Congress to consider at the beginning a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of American society the familyAnd speaking of the family lets turn to a matter on the mind of every American parent tonight education We all know the sorry story of the sixties and seventiessoaring spending plummeting test scoresand that hopeful trend of the eighties when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality and test scores started back up Theres a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times In a childs education money can never take the place of basics like discipline hard work and yes homeworkAs a nation we do of course spend heavily on educationmore than we spend on defense Yet across our country Governors like New Jerseys Tom Kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend Opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates merit payso that good teachers get As as well as applesand stronger curriculum as Secretary Bennett has proposed for high schoolsthese imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in Americas schools How can we help Well we can talk about and push for these reforms But the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the States local communities and most of all to the parents and teachersMy friends some years ago the Federal Government declared war on poverty and poverty won  Today the Federal Government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than 100 billion a year on them What has all this money done Well too often it has only made poverty harder to escape Federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem With the best of intentions government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty the family Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom passed from one generation to the next of too many fragmented familiesIt is timethis may be the most radical thing Ive said in 7 years in this officeits time for Washington to show a little humility There are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities around the Nation It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights States have begun to show us the way Theyve demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work Let us give the States more flexibility and encourage more reforms Lets start making our welfare system the first rung on Americas ladder of opportunity a boost up from dependency not a graveyard but a birthplace of hopeAnd now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life The first is an untold American success story Recently we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs Cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began We can be proud that our students are just saying no to drugs But let us remember what this menace requires commitment from every part of America and every single American a commitment to a drugfree America The war against drugs is a war of individual battles a crusade with many heroes including Americas young people and also someone very special to me She has helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs Nancy much credit belongs to you and I want to express to you your husbands pride and your countrys thanks Surprised you didnt I Well now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront Tonight I call Americaa good nation a moral peopleto charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand To those who say this violates a womans right to control of her own body Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all Federal funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making of course an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother Our JudeoChristian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in selfdefense But with that one exception let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt I pledge to you tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of Americans so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love themAnd let me add here So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nations health and vigor The Congress opens its proceedings each day as does the Supreme Court with an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being Yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray I believe Congress should pass our school prayer amendmentNow to make sure there is a full nine member Supreme Court to interpret the law to protect the rights of all Americans I urge the Senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highest Court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciaryHere then are our domestic priorities Yet if the Congress and the administration work together even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutionsOur policies consistently received the strongest support of the late Congressman Dan Daniel of Virginia Im sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passingOne of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth A creative competitive America is the answer to a changing world not trade wars that would close doors create greater barriers and destroy millions of jobs We should always remember Protectionism is destructionism Americas jobs Americas growth Americas future depend on tradetrade that is free open and fairThis year we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this Earth Im speaking of the historic free trade agreement negotiated between our country and Canada And I can also tell you that were determined to expand this concept south as well as north Next month I will be traveling to Mexico where trade matters will be of foremost concern And over the next several months our Congress and the Canadian Parliament can make the start of such a North American accord a reality Our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade from the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle unites the people of the Western Hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange when all borders become what the USCanadian border so long has been a meeting place rather than a dividing lineThis movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and against totalitarian rule This global democratic revolution has removed the specter so frightening a decade ago of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world In South and Central America only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976 Today over 90 percent of Latin Americans live in nations committed to democratic principles And the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destinyIn Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders The recent revelations of a former highlevel Sandinista major Roger Miranda show us that even as they talk peace the Communist Sandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large 600000man army Yet even as these plans are made the Sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding at its crest Because of the freedom fighters who are resisting Communist rule the Sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights negotiate with church authorities and release a few political prisonersThe focus is on the Sandinistas their promises and their actions There is a consensus among the four Central American democratic Presidents that the Sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of Central America The Sandinistas again have promised reforms Their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in Nicaragua I ask Congress to pass this request Let us be for the people of Nicaragua what Lafayette Pulaski and Von Steuben were for our forefathers and the cause of American independenceSo too in Afghanistan the freedom fighters are the key to peace We support the Mujahidin There can be no settlement unless all Soviet troops are removed and the Afghan people are allowed genuine selfdetermination I have made my views on this matter known to Mr Gorbachev But not just Nicaragua or Afghanistanyes everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world freedom fighters rising up in Cambodia and Angola fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred Their cause is our cause freedomYet even as we work to expand world freedom we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war But lets have no illusions Three years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests jeopardizing earlier hardwon goals We must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate stable defense spending a top goal both this year and in the futureThis same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well But the resolve of America and its NATO allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction Our recently signed INF treaty is historic because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history including several forms of shortnotice onsite inspection I submitted the treaty today and I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement  Thank you very muchIn addition to the INF treaty were within reach of an even more significant START agreement that will reduce US and Soviet longrange missileor strategic arsenals by half But let me be clear Our approach is not to seek agreement for agreements sake but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies We will never put our security at riskor that of our alliesjust to reach an agreement with the Soviets No agreement is better than a bad agreementAs I mentioned earlier our efforts are to give future generations what we never hada future free of nuclear terror Reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step SDI another Our funding request for our Strategic Defense Initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defense budget SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent SDI has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction It reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer more stable basis for deterrence We must also remember that SDI is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident a Chernobyl of the sky or an accidental launch or some madman who might come alongWeve seen such changes in the world in 7 years As totalitarianism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent As the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive we have left behind the days of retreat America is again a vigorous leader of the free world a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests No legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevents a paralysis of American power from ever occurring againBut my thoughts tonight go beyond this and I hope youll let me end this evening with a personal reflection You know the world could never be quite the same again after Jacob Shallus a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our Constitution And in a quiet but final way the course of human events was forever altered when on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike in an obscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg Lincoln spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the EarthAt the start of this decade I suggested that we live in equally momentous times that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet pleasant greening land called America Not everything has been made perfect in 7 years nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years but before us this year and beyond are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedomIt means too that the young Americans I spoke of 7 years ago as well as those who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores this night and seeing for the first time the lights of this Capital Citythe lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great menit means those young Americans will find a city of hope in a land that is freeWe can be proud that for them and for us as those lights along the Potomac are still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two centuries and as we pray God they always will that another generation of Americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called America this shining city on a hill this government of by and for the peopleThank you and God bless you
Good evening As I am speaking to you now General Secretary Gorbachev is leaving on his return trip to the Soviet Union His departure marks the end of three historic days here in Washington in which Mr Gorbachev and I continued to build a foundation for better relations between our governments and our peoples During these three days we took a steponly a first step but still a critical onetoward building a more durable peace indeed a step that may be the most important taken since World War II to slow down the arms buildupIm referring to the treaty that we signed Tuesday afternoon in the East Room of the White House I believe this treaty represents a landmark in postwar history because it is not just an arms control but an arms reduction agreement Unlike treaties of the past this agreement does not simply establish ceilings for new weapons It actually reduces the number of such weapons In fact it altogether abolishes an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missilesThe verification measures in this treaty are also something new with farreaching implications Onsite inspections and shortnotice inspections will be permitted within the Soviet Union Again this is a firsttime event a breakthrough and thats why I believe this treaty will not only lessen the threat of war it can also speed along a process that may someday remove that threat entirelyIndeed this treaty and all that weve achieved during this summit signals a broader understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union It is an understanding that will help keep the peace as we work toward the ultimate goal of our foreign policy a world where the people of every land can decide for themselves their form of government and way of lifeYet as important as the INF treaty is there is a further and even more crucial point about the last three days and the entire summit process SovietAmerican relations are no longer focused only on arms control issues They now cover a far broader agenda one that has at its root realism and candor Let me explain this with a saying Ive often repeated Nations do not distrust each other because theyre armed they are armed because they distrust each other And just as real peace means the presence of freedom and justice as well as the absence of war so too summits must be discussions not just about arms but about the fundamental differences that cause nations to be armedDealing then with the deeper sources of conflict between nations and systems of government is a practical and moral imperative And thats why it was vital to establish a broader summit agenda one that dealt not only with arms reductions but also peopletopeople contacts between our nations and most important the issues of human rights and regional conflictsThis is the summit agenda weve adopted By doing so weve dealt not just with arms control issues but also with fundamental problems such as Soviet expansionism human rights violations as well as our own moral opposition to the ideology that justifies such practices In this way we have put SovietAmerican relations on a far more candid and far more realistic footing It also means that while theres movementindeed dramatic movementin the arms reduction area much remains to be done in that area as well as in these other critical areas that Ive mentioned especiallyand this goes without sayingin advancing our goal of a world open to the expansion of human freedom and the growth of democratic governmentSo much work lies ahead Let me explain On the matter of regional conflicts I spoke candidly with Mr Gorbachev on the issues of Afghanistan IranIraq Cambodia Angola and Nicaragua I continue to have high hopesand he assured me that he did toothat we can have real cooperation in resolving regional conflicts on terms that promote peace and freedom This is essential to a lasting improvement in our relationsSo too on human rights there was some very limited movement resolution of a number of individual eases in which prisoners will be released or exit visas granted There were assurances of future more substantial movement which we hope to see become a realityAnd finally with regard to the last item on our agendascientific educational cultural and economic exchangeswe agreed to expand cooperation in ways that will break down some of the artificial barriers between our nations For example agreement was reached to expand and improve civil air service between our two countriesBut let me point out here that while much work is ahead of us the progress weve made especially in arms reduction does reflect a better understanding between ourselves and the Soviets It also reflects something deeper You see since my first meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev in 1985 I have always regarded you the American people as full participants in our discussions Though it may surprise Mr Gorbachev to discover that all this time there has been a third party in the room with us I do firmly believe the principal credit for the patience and persistence that brought success this year belongs to you the American peopleYour support over these last seven years has laid the basis for these negotiations Your support made it possible for us to rebuild our military strength to liberate Grenada to strike hard against terrorism in Libya and more recently to protect our strategic interests and bolster our friends in the Persian Gulf Your support made possible our policy of helping freedom fighters like those in Afghanistan Nicaragua Angola Cambodia and other places around the globe And when last year at Reykjavik I refused Soviet demands that we trade away SDI our Strategic Defense Initiative that could erect a space shield against ballistic missiles your overwhelming support made it clear to the Soviet leaders that the American people prefer no deal to a bad deal and will back their President on matters of national securityIn short your support for our foreign policy goalsbuilding a safer peace as we advance the cause of world freedomhas helped bring the Soviets to the bargaining table It makes it possible now to hope for a real fundamental improvement in our relationsYou know the question has often been asked whether democratic leaders who are accountable to their people arent at a grave disadvantage in negotiating with leaders of totalitarian States who bear no such burden Well believe me I think I can answer that question I can speak from personal experience Over the long run no leader at the bargaining table can enjoy any greater advantage than the knowledge that he has behind him a people who are strong and free and alert and resolved to remain that waypeople like you And its this kind of informed and enlightened support this hidden strength of democratic government that enabled us to do what we did this week at the Washington summitNow that the treatys been signed it will be submitted to the Senate for the next step the ratification process I will meet with the leadership of Congress here tomorrow morning and Im confident that the Senate will now act in an expeditious way to fulfill its duty under our ConstitutionTo this end let me explain the background In the mid and late1970s the Soviets began to deploy hundreds of new mobile intermediaterange missiles capable of destroying major cities and military installations in Europe and Asia This action was an unprovoked new dimension of the threat against our friends and allies on both continents a new threat to which the democratic nations had no comparable counterDespite intense pressure from the Soviets NATO proceeded with what we called a twotrack policy First we would deploy a limited number of our own INF missiles as a deterrent but at the same time push hard in negotiations to do away with this entirely new nuclear threat And we set out to do this with a formula I first put forward in 1981 It was called the zerooption It meant the complete elimination of these missiles on both sides Well at first many called this a mere propaganda ploy some even here in this country But we were persistent our allies steadfast and eventually the Soviets returned to the bargaining table The result is our INF treatyAs you see from the map on the screen now the Soviet missiles which will be removed and eliminated under the treaty have been a major threat to the security of our friends and allies on two continents Europe and Asia Under the terms of this treaty we will be eliminating 400 deployed warheads while the Soviet Union eliminates 1600 or four times as many Now let me also point out that this does not however leave NATO unprotected In fact we will maintain a substantial deterrent force on the ground in the air and at sea Our commitment to NATOs strategy of being able to respond as necessary to any form of aggression remains steadfastAnd with regard to verification as Ive mentioned we have the breakthroughs of onsite inspections and shortnotice inspections not only at potential missile deployment sites but at the facility where the Soviet SS20 missiles and their components have been assembled We have a verification procedure that assures each side that the missiles of the other side have been destroyed and that new ones arent builtHere then is a treaty that shows how persistence and consistency eventually can pay off in arms negotiations And let me assure you too that this treaty has been accomplished with unprecedented consultation with our allies and friends I have spoken personally with the leaders of the major democracies as has Secretary Shultz and our diplomats This treaty has full allied support But if persistence is paying off in our arms reduction efforts the question of human rights and regional conflicts are still problems in our relations But I am pleased that some progress has been made in these areas alsoNow in addition to these candid exchanges on our fourpart agenda Mr Gorbachev and I did do some important planning for a Moscow summit next year We agreed that we must redouble our efforts to reach agreements on reducing the levels of US and Soviet longrange or strategic nuclear arms as I have proposed in the START negotiations He and I made real progress toward our goal first agreed to at Geneva to achieve deep 50percent cuts in our arsenals of those powerful weapons We agreed that we should build on our efforts to achieve agreement on a START treaty at the earliest possible date and weve instructed our delegations in Geneva accordinglyNow I believe deep reductions in these offensive weapons along with the development of SDI would do much to make the world safer For that reason I made it clear that our SDI program will continue and that when we have a defense ready to deploy we will do soAbout the future Mr Gorbachev and I also agreed that as nuclear weapons are reduced it becomes all the more important to redress the disparities in conventional and chemical weapons where the Soviets now enjoy significant advantages over the United States and our allies I think then from all of this you can see not only the direction of SovietAmerican relations but the larger framework of American foreign policy As I told the British Parliament in 1982 we seek to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era the threat of nuclear war and the threat of totalitarianismAnd thats why by pursuing SDI which is a defense against offensive missiles and by going for arms reduction rather than just arms control were moving away from the socalled policy of mutual assured destruction by which nations hold each other hostage to nuclear terror and destruction So too we are saying that the postwar policy of containment is no longer enough that the goal of American foreign policy is both world peace and world freedom that as a people we hope and will work for a day when all of Gods children will enjoy the human dignity that their creator intended I believe we gained some ground with regard to that cause in these last few daysSince my first days in office I have argued that the future belongs not to repressive or totalitarian ways of life but to the cause of freedomfreedom of the marketplace freedom to speak assemble and vote And when we see the progress of democracy in these last years from Latin America to Asia we must be optimistic about the future of our childrenWhen we were together in Iceland Mr Gorbachev told me that this sort of talk is sometimes viewed in the Soviet Union as a threat but I told him then and I have said since then that this is no threat at all but only a dream the American dream And its a dream that has meant so much to so many a dream that still shines out to the worldYou know a couple of years ago Nancy and I were deeply moved by a story told by former New York Times reporter and Greek immigrant Nicholas Gage Its the story of Eleni his mother a woman caught in one of the terrible struggles of the postwar era the Greek civil war at the end of World War II a mother who was tried and executed because she smuggled her children out to safety in AmericaIt is also the story of how her son secretly vowed to return to Greece someday to take vengeance on the man who had sent his mother to her death But at the end of the story Nicholas Gage finds he cannot extract the vengeance he promised himself Mr Gage writes it would have relieved the pain that had filled him for so many years but it would also have broken the one bridge still connecting him to his mother that part of him most like her As he tells it  and her final cry was not a curse on her killers but an invocation of what shed died fora declaration of love These simple last words of Mr Gages mother of Eleni were My childrenHow that cry echoes down through the centuries a cry for all children of the world a cry for peace for a world of love and understanding And it is the hope of heeding such wordsthe call for freedom and peace spoken by a chosen people in a promised land the call spoken by the Nazar carpenterNazarene carpenter I should say standing at the Sea of Galilee the carpenter whose birth into the poverty of a stable we celebrateit is these words that we remember as the holiday season approaches and we reflect on the events of this week here in WashingtonSo let us remember the children and the future we want for them And let us never forget that this promise of peace and freedom the gift that is ours as Americans the gift that we seek to share with all the world depends for its strength on the spiritual source from which it comes So during this holy season let us also reflect that in the prayers of simple people there is more power and might than that possessed by all the great statesmen or armies of the Earth Let us then thank God for all His blessings to this nation and ask Him for His help and guidance so that we might continue the work of peace and foster the hope of a world where human freedom is enshrinedTo sum up then This summit was a clear success We made progress on each item in our fourpart agenda Mr Gorbachev and I have agreed to meet in several months in Moscow to continue what weve achieved during these past three days I believe there is reason for both hope and optimism
Fellow citizensFor eight years it has been my honor to serve as your President The first decade of this new century has been a period of consequencea time set apart Tonight with a thankful heart I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have traveled together and the future of our nationFive days from now the world will witness the vitality of American democracy In a tradition dating back to our founding the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you the American people Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to PresidentElect Obama his wife Michelle and their two beautiful girlsTonight I am filled with gratitudeto Vice President Cheney and members of my administration to Laura who brought joy to this house and love to my life to our wonderful daughters Barbara and Jenna to my parents whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime And above all I thank the American people for the trust you have given me I thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits And I thank you for the countless acts of courage generosity and grace that I have witnessed these past eight yearsThis evening my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this houseSeptember the 11th 2001 That morning terrorists took nearly 3000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smokefilled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93 I remember Arlene Howard who gave me her fallen sons police shield as a reminder of all that was lost And I still carry his badgeAs the years passed most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 911 But I never did Every morning I received a briefing on the threats to our nation I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safeOver the past seven years a new Department of Homeland Security has been created The military the intelligence community and the FBI have been transformed Our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists movements freeze their finances and break up their plots And with strong allies at our side we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored alQaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United StatesThere is legitimate debate about many of these decisions But there can be little debate about the results America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil This is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safelaw enforcement officers intelligence analysts homeland security and diplomatic personnel and the men and women of the United States Armed ForcesOur nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families And America owes you a debt of gratitude And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight There has been no higher honor than serving as your CommanderinChiefThe battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems Under one a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology condemns women to subservience and marks unbelievers for murder The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and justice light the path to peaceThis is the belief that gave birth to our nation And in the long run advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens When people live in freedom they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror When people have hope in the future they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism So around the world America is promoting human liberty human rights and human dignity Were standing with dissidents and young democracies providing AIDS medicine to dying patientsto bring dying patients back to life and sparing mothers and babies from malaria And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nationsFor eight years weve also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home Across our country students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faithbased programs Vulnerable human life is better protected Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled Americas air and water and lands are measurably cleaner And the federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John RobertsWhen challenges to our prosperity emerged we rose to meet them Facing the prospect of a financial collapse we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy These are very tough times for hardworking families but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted All Americans are in this together And together with determination and hard work we will restore our economy to the path of growth We will show the world once again the resilience of Americas free enterprise systemLike all who have held this office before me I have experienced setbacks There are things I would do differently if given the chance Yet Ive always acted with the best interests of our country in mind I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisionsThe decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country and there are some guiding principles that should shape our courseWhile our nation is safer than it was seven years ago the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict But we have been given solemn responsibilities and we must meet them We must resist complacency We must keep our resolve And we must never let down our guardAt the same time we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose In the face of threats from abroad it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward But we must reject isolationism and its companion protectionism Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger In the 21st century security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad If America does not lead the cause of freedom that cause will not be ledAs we address these challengesand others we cannot foresee tonightAmerica must maintain our moral clarity Ive often spoken to you about good and evil and this has made some uncomfortable But good and evil are present in this world and between the two of them there can be no compromise Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time everywhere Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth We must always be willing to act in their defenseand to advance the cause of peacePresident Thomas Jefferson once wrote I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago I share that optimism America is a young country full of vitality constantly growing and renewing itself And even in the toughest times we lift our eyes to the broad horizon aheadI have confidence in the promise of America because I know the character of our people This is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger and compassion in the face of suffering We see examples of Americas character all around us And Laura and I have invited some of them to join us in the White House this eveningWe see Americas character in Dr Tony Recasner a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina We see it in Julio Medina a former inmate who leads a faithbased program to help prisoners returning to society Weve seen it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow MarinesWe see Americas character in Bill Krissoffa surgeon from California His son Nathana Marinegave his life in Iraq When I met Dr Krissoff and his family he delivered some surprising news He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son This good man was 60 years old18 years above the age limit But his petition for a waiver was granted and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight because he will soon deploy to Iraq where he will help save Americas wounded warriorsand uphold the legacy of his fallen sonIn citizens like these we see the best of our countryresilient and hopeful caring and strong These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America We have faced danger and trial and theres more ahead But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals this great nation will never tire never falter and never failIt has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President There have been good days and tough days But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people I have been blessed to represent this nation we love And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any othercitizen of the United States of AmericaAnd so my fellow Americans for the final time Good night May God bless this house and our next President And may God bless you and our wonderful country Thank you
Good morning For years Americas automakers have faced serious challenges  burdensome costs a shrinking share of the market and declining profits In recent months the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe Now some US auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse  and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the federal governmentThis is a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of government On the one hand government has a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system On the other hand government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economyAddressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities If we were to allow the free market to take its course now it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers Under ordinary economic circumstances I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay  and I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of businessBut these are not ordinary circumstances In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession allowing the US auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action The question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed Some argue the wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through Chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws  and provide federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court But given the current state of the auto industry and the economy Chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American automakers at this timeAmerican consumers understand why If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy you worry that parts and servicing will not be available and you question the value of your warranty And with consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers it would be more difficult for auto companies to recoverAdditionally the financial crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated  and they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuringThe convergence of these factors means theres too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies My economic advisors believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession And it would leave the next President to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of officeA more responsible option is to give the auto companies an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy  and a brief window in which to do it And that is why my administration worked with Congress on a bill to provide automakers with loans to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plans for viability This legislation earned bipartisan support from majorities in both houses of CongressUnfortunately despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcies in the American auto industry Congress was unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourning this yearThis means the only way to avoid a collapse of the US auto industry is for the executive branch to step in The American people want the auto companies to succeed and so do I So today Im announcing that the federal government will grant loans to auto companies under conditions similar to those Congress considered last weekThese loans will provide help in two ways First they will give automakers three months to put in place plans to restructure into viable companies  which we believe they are capable of doing Second if restructuring cannot be accomplished outside of bankruptcy the loans will provide time for companies to make the legal and financial preparations necessary for an orderly Chapter 11 process that offers a better prospect of longterm success  and gives consumers confidence that they can continue to buy American carsBecause Congress failed to make funds available for these loans the plan Im announcing today will be drawn from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this fall The terms of the loans will require auto companies to demonstrate how they would become viable They must pay back all their loans to the government and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth This restructuring will require meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry  management labor unions creditors bondholders dealers and suppliersIn particular automakers must meet conditions that experts agree are necessary for longterm viability  including putting their retirement plans on a sustainable footing persuading bondholders to convert their debt into capital the companies need to address immediate financial shortfalls and making their compensation competitive with foreign automakers who have major operations in the United States If a company fails to come up with a viable plan by March 31st it will be required to repay its federal loansThe automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform These conditions send a clear message to everyone involved in the future of American automakers The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now  or the only option will be bankruptcyThe actions Im announcing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary But given the situation it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge facing our nation By giving the auto companies a chance to restructure we will shield the American people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time And we will give American workers an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than beforeThank you
Thank you very much Please be seated Thank you Larry thank you for the introduction Thank you for giving Laura and me a chance to come to this historic hall to talk about a big issue facing the world And today I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and for me to outline the steps that America and our partners are taking and are going to take to overcome this financial crisisAnd I thank the Manhattan Institute for all you have done I appreciate the fact that I am here in a fabulous city to give this speech  People say are you confident about our future And the answer is absolutely And its easy to be confident when youre a city like New York City After all theres an unbelievable spirit in this city This is a city whose skyline has offered immigrants their first glimpse of freedom This is a city where people rallied when that freedom came under attack This is a city whose capital markets have attracted investments from around the world and financed the dreams of entrepreneurs all across America This is a city that has been and will always be the financial capital of the world And I am grateful to be in the presence of two men who serve ably and nobly New York City  Mayor Koch and Mayor Giuliani Thank you all for coming Glad youre here  I thank the Manhattan Institute Board of Trustees and its Chairman Paul Singer for doing good work being a good policy center  And before I begin I must say I would hope that Ray Kelly would tell New Yorks finest how much I appreciate the incredible hospitality that we are always shown here in New York City Youre the head of a fabulous police force and we thank you very much sir We live in a world in which our economies are interconnected Prosperity and progress have reached farther than any time in our history Unfortunately as we have seen in recent months financial turmoil anywhere in the world affects economies everywhere in the world And so this weekend Im going to host a Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy with leaders from developed and developing nations that account for nearly 90 percent of the world economy Leaders of the World Bank the International Monetary Fund the United Nations and the Financial Stability Forum are going to be there as well Well have dinner at the White House tomorrow night and well meet most of the day on SaturdayThe leaders attending this weekends meeting agree on a clear purpose  to address the current crisis and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future We also agree that this undertaking is too large to be accomplished in a single session The issues are too complex the problem is too significant to try to solve or to come up with reasonable recommendations in just one meeting So this summit will be the first of a series of meetingsIt will focus on five key objectives understanding the causes of the global crisis reviewing the effectiveness of our responses thus far developing principles for reforming our financial and regulatory systems launching a specific action plan to implement those principles and reaffirming our conviction that free market principles offer the surest path to lasting prosperity First were working toward a common understanding of the causes behind the global crisis Different countries will naturally bring different perspectives but there are some points on which we can all agreeOver the past decade the world experienced a period of strong economic growth Nations accumulated huge amounts of savings and looked for safe places to invest them Because of our attractive political legal and entrepreneurial climates the United States and other developed nations received a large share of that moneyThe massive inflow of foreign capital combined with low interest rates produced a period of easy credit And that easy credit especially affected the housing market Flush with cash many lenders issued mortgages and many borrowers could not afford them Financial institutions then purchased these loans packaged them together and converted them into complex securities designed to yield large returns These securities were then purchased by investors and financial institutions in the United States and Europe and elsewhere  often with little analysis of their true underlying valueThe financial crisis was ignited when booming housing markets began to decline As home values dropped many borrowers defaulted on their mortgages and institutions holding securities backed by those mortgages suffered serious losses Because of outdated regulatory structures and poor risk management practices many financial institutions in America and Europe were too highly leveraged When capital ran short many faced severe financial jeopardy This led to highprofile failures of financial institutions in America and Europe led to contractions and widespread anxiety  all of which contributed to sharp declines in the equity marketsThese developments have placed a heavy burden on hardworking people around the world Stock market drops have eroded the value of retirement accounts and pension funds The tightening of credit has made it harder for families to borrow money for cars or home improvements or education of the children Businesses have found it harder to get loans to expand their operations and create jobs Many nations have suffered job losses and have serious concerns about the worsening economy Developing nations have been hit hard as nervous investors have withdrawn their capitalWe are faced with the prospect of a global meltdown And so weve responded with bold measures Im a marketoriented guy but not when Im faced with the prospect of a global meltdown At Saturdays summit were going to review the effectiveness of our actionsHere in the United States we have taken unprecedented steps to boost liquidity recapitalize financial institutions guarantee most new debt issued by insured banks and prevent the disorderly collapse of large interconnected enterprises These were historic actions taken necessary to make  necessary so that the economy would not melt down and affect millions of our fellow citizensIn Europe governments are also purchasing equity in banks and providing government guarantees for loans In Asia nations like China and Japan and South Korea have lowered interest rates and have launched significant economic stimulus plans In the Middle East nations like Kuwait and the UAE have guaranteed deposits and opened up new government lending to banksIn addition nations around the world have taken unprecedented joint measures Last month a number of central banks carried out a coordinated interest rate cut The Federal Reserve is extending needed liquidity to central banks around the world The IMF and World Bank are working to ensure that developing nations can weather this crisisThis crisis did not develop overnight and its not going to be solved overnight But our actions are having an impact Credit markets are beginning to thaw Businesses are gaining access to essential shortterm financing A measure of stability is returning to financial systems here at home and around the world Its going to require more time for these improvements to fully take hold and theres going to be difficult days ahead But the United States and our partner are taking the right steps to get through this crisisIn addition to addressing the current crisis we will also need to make broader reforms to strengthen the global economy over the long term This weekend leaders will establish principles for adapting our financial systems to the realities of the 21st century marketplace We will discuss specific actions we can take to implement these principles We will direct our finance ministers to work with other experts and report back to us with detailed recommendations on further reasonable actionsOne vital principle of reform is that our nations must make our financial markets more transparent For example we should consider improving accounting rules for securities so that investors around the world can understand the true value of the assets they purchaseSecondly we must ensure that markets firms and financial products are properly regulated For example credit default swaps  financial products that insure against potential losses  should be processed through centralized clearinghouses instead of through unregulated over the counter markets By bringing greater stability to this large and important financial sector we reduce the risk to our overall financial systemsThird we must enhance the integrity of our financial markets For example authorities in every nation should take a fresh look at the rules governing market manipulation and fraud  and ensure that investors are properly protectedFourth we must strengthen cooperation among the worlds financial authorities For example leading nations should better coordinate national laws and regulations We should also reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank which are based largely on the economic order of 1944 To better reflect the realities of todays global economy both the IMF and World Bank should modernize their governance structures They should consider extending greater voter  voting power to dynamic developing nations especially as they increase their contributions to these institutions They should consider ways to streamline their executive boards and make them more representativeIn addition to these important  to these management changes we should move forward with other reforms to make the IMF and World Bank more transparent accountable and effective For example the IMF should agree to work more closely with member countries to ensure that their exchange rate policies are marketoriented and fair And the World Bank should ensure its development programs reflect the priorities of the people they are designed to serve  and focus on measurable resultsAll these steps require decisive actions from governments around the world At the same time we must recognize that government intervention is not a cureall For example some blame the crisis on insufficient regulation of the American mortgage market But many European countries had much more extensive regulations and still experienced problems almost identical to our ownHistory has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market it is too much government involvement in the market  We saw this in the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Because these firms were chartered by the United States Congress many believed they were backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government Investors put huge amounts of money into Fannie and Freddie which they used to build up irresponsibly large portfolios of mortgagebacked securities And when the housing market declined these securities of course plummeted in value It took a taxpayerfunded rescue to keep Fannie and Freddie from collapsing in a way that would have devastated the global financial system And there is a clear lesson Our aim should not be more government  it should be smarter governmentAll this leads to the most important principle that should guide our work While reforms in the financial sector are essential the longterm solution to todays problems is sustained economic growth And the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people This is a decisive moment for the global economy In the wake of the financial crisis voices from the left and right are equating the free enterprise system with greed and exploitation and failure Its true this crisis included failures  by lenders and borrowers and by financial firms and by governments and independent regulators But the crisis was not a failure of the free market system And the answer is not to try to reinvent that system It is to fix the problems we face make the reforms we need and move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globeLike any other system designed by man capitalism is not perfect It can be subject to excesses and abuse But it is by far the most efficient and just way of structuring an economy At its most basic level capitalism offers people the freedom to choose where they work and what they do the opportunity to buy or sell products they want and the dignity that comes with profiting from their talent and hard work The free market system provides the incentives that lead to prosperity  the incentive to work to innovate to save to invest wisely and to create jobs for others And as millions of people pursue these incentives together whole societies benefitFree market capitalism is far more than economic theory It is the engine of social mobility  the highway to the American Dream Its what makes it possible for a husband and wife to start their own business or a new immigrant to open a restaurant or a single mom to go back to college and to build a better career It is what allowed entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to change the way the world sells products and searches for information Its what transformed America from a rugged frontier to the greatest economic power in history  a nation that gave the world the steamboat and the airplane the computer and the CAT scan the Internet and the iPodUltimately the best evidence for free market capitalism is its performance compared to other economic systems Free markets allowed Japan an island with few natural resources to recover from war and grow into the worlds secondlargest economy Free markets allowed South Korea to make itself into one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world Free markets turned small areas like Singapore and Hong Kong and Taiwan into global economic players Today the success of the worlds largest economies comes from their embrace of free marketsMeanwhile nations that have pursued other models have experienced devastating results Soviet communism starved millions bankrupted an empire and collapsed as decisively as the Berlin Wall Cuba once known for its vast fields of cane is now forced to ration sugar And while Iran sits atop giant oil reserves its people cannot put enough gasoline in its  in their carsThe record is unmistakable If you seek economic growth if you seek opportunity if you seek social justice and human dignity the free market system is the way to go  And it would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of successJust as important as maintaining free markets within countries is maintaining the free movement of goods and services between countries When nations open their markets to trade and investment their businesses and farmers and workers find new buyers for their products Consumers benefit from more choices and better prices Entrepreneurs can get their ideas off the ground with funding from anywhere in the world Thanks in large part to open markets the volume of global trade today is nearly 30 times greater than it was six decades ago  and some of the most dramatic gains have come in the developing worldAs President I have seen the transformative power of trade up close Ive been to a Caterpillar factory in East Peoria Illinois where thousands of goodpaying American jobs are supported by exports Ive walked the grounds of a trade fair in Ghana where I met women who support their families by exporting handmade dresses and jewelry Ive spoken with a farmer in Guatemala who decided to grow highvalue crops he could sell overseas  and helped create more than 1000 jobsStories like these show why it is so important to keep markets open to trade and investment This openness is especially urgent during times of economic strain Shortly after the stock market crash in 1929 Congress passed the SmootHawley tariff  a protectionist measure designed to wall off Americas economy from global competition The result was not economic security It was economic ruin And leaders around the world must keep this example in mind and reject the temptation of protectionism There are clearcut ways for nations to demonstrate the commitment to open markets The United States Congress has an immediate opportunity by approving free trade agreements with Colombia Peru and South Korea America and other wealthy nations must also ensure this crisis does not become an excuse to reverse our engagement with the developing world And developing nations should continue policies that foster enterprise and investment As well all nations should pledge to conclude a framework this year that leads to a successful Doha agreementWere facing this challenge together and were going to get through it together The United States is determined to show the way back to economic growth and prosperity I know some may question whether Americas leadership in the global economy will continue The world can be confident that it will because our markets are flexible and we can rebound from setbacks We saw that resilience in the 1940s when America pulled itself out of Depression marshaled a powerful army and helped save the world from tyranny We saw that resilience in the 1980s when Americans overcame gas lines turned stagflation into strong economic growth and won the Cold War We saw that resilience after September the 11th 2001 when our nation recovered from a brutal attack revitalized our shaken economy and rallied the forces of freedom in the great ideological struggle of the 21st centuryThe world will see the resilience of America once again We will work with our partners to correct the problems in the global financial system We will rebuild our economic strength And we will continue to lead the world toward prosperity and peaceThanks for coming and God bless 
A short time ago the House of Representatives passed a bill that is essential to helping Americas economy weather the financial crisis The Senate passed the same legislation on Wednesday night And when Congress sends me the final bill Im going to sign it into lawThere were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge But thanks to the hard work of members of both parties in both Houses  and a spirit of cooperation between Capitol Hill and my administration  we completed this bill in a timely manner Im especially grateful for the contributions of Speaker Nancy Pelosi Minority Leader John Boehner Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Minority Whip Roy Blunt Chairman Barney Frank Ranking Member Spencer BachusBy coming together on this legislation we have acted boldly to help prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country We have shown the world that the United States of America will stabilize our financial markets and maintain a leading role in the global economyA major problem in our financial system is that banks have restricted the flow of credit to businesses and consumers many of the assets these banks are holding have lost value The legislation Congress passed today addresses this problem head on by providing a variety of new tools to the government  such as allowing us to purchase some of the troubled assets and creating a new government insurance program that will guarantee the value of others The bill also ensures that these new programs are carried out in a way that protects taxpayers It prevents failed executives from receiving windfalls from taxpayers dollars It establishes a bipartisan board to oversee the plans implementationTaken together these steps represent decisive action to ease the credit crunch that is now threatening our economy With a smoother flow of credit more businesses will be able to stock their shelves and meet their payrolls More families will be able to get loans for cars and homes and college education More state and local governments will be able to fund basic servicesThe bill includes other provisions to help American consumers and businesses It includes tax incentives for businesses to invest and create jobs It temporarily expands federal insurance for bank and credit union deposits from 100000 to 250000  a vital safeguard for consumers and small businesses It provides families with relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax which would otherwise increase taxes for 26 million taxpayers by an average of 2200I know some Americans have concerns about this legislation especially about the governments role and the bills cost As a strong supporter of free enterprise I believe government intervention should occur only when necessary In this situation action is clearly necessary And ultimately the cost  ultimately the cost to taxpayers will be far less than the initial outlay See the government will purchase troubled assets and once the market recovers it is likely that many of the assets will go up in value And over time Americans should expect that much  if not all  of the tax dollars we invest will be paid backAmericans should also expect that it will take some time for this legislation to have its full impact on our economy Exercising the authorities in this bill in a responsible way will require a careful analysis and deliberation This will be done as expeditiously as possible but it cannot be accomplished overnight Well take the time necessary to design an effective program that achieves its objectives  and does not waste taxpayer dollarsOur economy continues to face serious challenges This morning we learned that America lost jobs again in September  disappointing news that underscores the urgency of the bill that Congress passed today It will take more time and determined effort to get through this difficult period But with confidence and leadership and bipartisan cooperation well overcome the challenges we face return our nation to a path of growth and job creation and longterm economic prosperity Thank you
Thank you all Deputy Secretary England thanks for the introduction One boss may not be here but the other one is  I appreciate your kind words Im pleased to be back here with the men and women of the Defense DepartmentOn this day in 2003 the United States began Operation Iraqi Freedom As the campaign unfolded tens and thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqi people and remove a regime that threatened free nationsFive years into this battle there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting whether the fight is worth winning and whether we can win it The answers are clear to me Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision and this is a fight America can and must winThe men and women who crossed into Iraq 5 years ago removed a tyrant liberated a country and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors Some of those troops are with us today and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment and so is the Commander in ChiefI appreciate Admiral Mullen the Joint Chiefs who are here Thanks for coming Secretary Donald Winter of the Navy Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us Admiral Thad Allen of the Coast Guard is with us Ambassador from Iraq is with us Mr Ambassador were proud to have you here Soldiers sailors marines airmen and coast mencoast guard men thanks for coming thanks for wearing the uniform Men and women of the Department of State are here as wellOperation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness Forces from the UK Australia Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations As they advanced our troops fought their way through sandstorms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky Our troops engaged in pitched battles with Fedayeen Saddam death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians They used women and children as human shields They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing but they couldnt stop the coalition advanceAided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history coalition forces raced across 350 miles of enemy territory destroying Republican Guard divisions pushing through the Karbala Gap capturing Saddam International Airport and liberating Baghdad in less than 1 monthAlong the way our troops added new chapters to the story of American military heroism During these first weeks of battle Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith and his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican Guard forces Sergeant Smith rallied his men He led a counterattack killing as many as 50 enemy soldiers before being fatally wounded His actions saved the lives of more than a hundred American troops and earned him the Medal of HonorToday in light of the challenges we have faced in Iraq some look back at this period as the easy part of the war Yet there was nothing easy about it The liberation of Iraq took incredible skill and amazing courage And the speed precision and brilliant execution of the campaign will be studied by military historians for years to comeWhat our troops found in Iraq following Saddams removal was horrifying They uncovered childrens prisons and torture chambers and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated in front of their families They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemed disloyal to Saddam And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves of thousands executed by the regimeBecause we acted Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men women and children Because we acted Saddams torture chambers and rape rooms and childrens prisons have been closed for good Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer paying the families of suicide bombers in the Holy Land Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer shooting at American and British aircraft patrolling the nofly zones and defying the will of the United Nations Because we acted the world is better and United States of America is saferWhen the Iraqi regime was removed it did not lay down its arms and surrender Instead former regime elements took off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight the emergence of a free Iraq And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking to stop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe havens from which to plot new attacks across the worldThe battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated but it is a fight we must win So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage and determination And as theyve battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq they have helped the Iraqi people reclaim their nation and helped a young democracy rise from the rubble of Saddam Husseins tyrannyOver the past 5 years we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls and chose their leaders in free elections We watched in horror as Al Qaida beheaded innocent captives and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq and they serve as a grim reminder The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we will face the enemy here at homeA little over a year ago the fight in Iraq was faltering Extremist elements were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos They had established safe havens in many parts of the country They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines And their strategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was working as pressures built here in Washington for withdrawal before the job was doneMy administration understood that America could not retreat in the face of terror And we knew that if we did not act the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen and spread and could eventually reach genocidal levels Baghdad could have disintegrated into a contagion of killing and Iraq could have descended into fullblown sectarian warfareSo we reviewed the strategy and changed course in Iraq We sent reinforcements into the country in a dramatic policy shift that is now known as the surge General David Petraeus took command with a new mission Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people pressure the enemy into strongholds and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country And that is precisely what we have doneIn Anbar Sunni tribal leaders had grown tired of Al Qaidas brutality and started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening To take advantage of this opportunity we sent 4000 additional marines to help these brave Iraqis drive Al Qaida from the Province As this effort succeeded it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight Soon similar uprisings began to spread across the country Today there are more than 90000 concerned local citizens who are protecting their communities from the terrorists and insurgents and the extremists The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward with a surge of its own theyve added more than 100000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year These Iraqi troops have fought bravely and thousands have given their lives in this struggleTogether these Americans and Iraqi forces have driven the terrorists from many of the sanctuaries they once held Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them There will be tough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead But theres no doubt in my mind because of the courage of our troops and the bravery of the Iraqis the Al Qaida terrorists in this region will suffer the same fate as Al Qaida suffered elsewhere in IraqAs we have fought Al Qaida coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shia extremist groups many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran A year ago these groups were on the rise Today they are increasingly isolated and Iraqis of all faiths are putting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their young democracyTo ensure that military progress in Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life we have doubled the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq These teams of civilian experts are serving all Iraqi18 Iraqi Provinces and theyre helping to strengthen responsible leaders and build up local economies and bring Iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up Theyre very effective Theyre helping give ordinary Iraqis confidence that by rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another they can claim their place in a free Iraq and build better lives for their familiesTheres still hard work to be done in Iraq The gains we have made are fragile and reversible But on this anniversary the American people should know that since the surge began the level of violence is significantly down civilian deaths are down sectarian killings are down attacks on American forces are down We have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives Our men and women in uniform are performing with characteristic honor and valor The surge is working And as a return on our success in Iraq weve begun bringing some of our troops homeThe surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror For the terrorists Iraq was supposed to be the place where Al Qaida rallied Arab masses to drive America out Instead Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive Al Qaida out In Iraq we are witnessing the first largescale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden his grim ideology and his murderous network And the significance of this development cannot be overstatedThe terrorist movement feeds on a sense of inevitability and claims to rise on the tide of history The accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting the extremists When Iraqi and American forces finish the job the effects will reverberate far beyond Iraqs borders Usama bin Laden once said When people see a strong horse and a weak horse by nature they will like the strong horse By defeating Al Qaida in Iraq we will show the world that Al Qaida is the weak horse We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the terrorists And we will show that the future of the Middle East does not belong to terror The future of the Middle East belongs to freedomThe challenge in this period ahead is to consolidate the gains we have made and seal the extremists defeat We have learned through hard experience what happens when we pull our forces back too fast the terrorists and extremists step in they fill vacuums establish safe havens and use them to spread chaos and carnage General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling with Al Qaida and insurgents and militia extremists regaining lost ground and increasing violenceMen and women of the Armed Forces Having come so far and achieved so much were not going to let this to happenNext month General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington to testify before Congress I will await their recommendations before making decisions on our troop levels in Iraq Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendations of our commanders And they must not jeopardize the hardfought gains our troops and civilians have made over the past yearSuccesses we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable yet some in Washington still call for retreat War critics can no longer credibly argue that were losing in Iraq so they now argue the war costs too much In recent months weve heard exaggerated amounts of the costs of this war No one arewould argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in IraqIf we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq the violence that is now declining would accelerate and Iraq would descend into chaos Al Qaida would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraqs borders with serious consequences for the worlds economyOut of such chaos in Iraq the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened with new recruits new resources and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America An emboldened Al Qaida with access to Iraqs oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations Iran would be emboldened as well with a renewed determination to develop nuclear weapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle East Our enemies would see an Americaan American failure in Iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolveTo allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make it more likely that America would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day a day in which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3000 people in ouron our soil a day after which in the following of that attack more than a million Americans lost work lost their jobs The terrorists intend even greater harm to our country And we have no greater responsibility than to defeat our enemies across the world so that they cannot carry out such an attackAs our coalition fights the enemy in Iraq weve stayed on the offensive on other fronts in the war on terror You know just a few weeks after commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom US forces captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind behind the September the 11th terrorist attacks we got him in Pakistan About the same time as we launched Operation Iraqi Freedom coalition forces thousands ofhundreds of miles away launched an assault on the terrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an operation called Operation Valiant StrikeThroughout the war on terror we have brought the enemywe have fought the enemy on every single battlefront And so long as terrorist danger remains the United States of America will continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its standWe will stay on the offense But in the long run defeating the terrorists requires an alternative to their murderous ideology And there we have another advantage Weve got a singular advantage with our military when it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice And we have another advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of libertySo were helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East A free Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them A free Iraq will be an example for others of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with hope By spreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East we will help free societies take root And when they do freedom will yield the peace that we all desireOur troops on the frontlines understand what is at stake They know that the mission in Iraq has been difficult and has been trying for our Nation because theyre the ones whove carried most of the burdens Theyre all volunteers who have stepped forward to defend America in a time of danger Some of them have gone out of their way to return to the fightOne of these brave Americans is a Marine Gunnery Sergeant named William Spanky Gibson In May of 2006 in Ramadi a terrorist snipers bullet ripped through his left knee doctors then amputated his leg After months of difficult rehabilitation Spanky was not only walking he was training for triathlonsLast year at the Escape from Alcatraz swim near San Francisco he met Marine General James Mattis who asked if theres anything he could do for him Spanky had just one request He asked to redeploy to Iraq Today hes serving in Fallujah the first fullleg amputee to return to the frontlines Heres what he says about his decision to return The Iraqis whereare where we were 232 years ago as a nation Now theyre starting a new nation and thats one of my big reasons for coming back here I wanted to tell the people of this country that Im back to help wherever I canWhen Americans like Spanky Gibson serve on our side the enemy in Iraq doesnt got a chance Were grateful to all the brave men and women of our military who have served the cause of freedom Youve done the hard work far from home and far from your loved ones We give thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this missionWe appreciate the fine civilians from many Departments who serve alongside you Many of you served in Iraq and Afghanistan and some have been on these fronts several times You will never forget the people who fought at your side You will always remember the comrades who served with you in combat but did not make the journey home America remembers them as well More than 4400 men and women have given their lives in the war on terror Well pray for their families Well always honor their memoryThe best way we can honor them is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain Five years ago tonight I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead we will accept no outcome but victory Today standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation I reaffirm the commitment The battle in Iraq is noble it is necessary and it is just And with your courage the battle in Iraq will end in victory God bless
