Good evening my fellow Americans I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID19 the progress weve made and the work we have left to doAnd it starts with understanding this Even as the Delta variant 19 sic has COVID19has been hitting this country hard we have the tools to combat the virus if we can come together as a country and use those toolsIf we raise our vaccination rate protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing and identify people who are infected we can and we will turn the tide on COVID19It will take a lot of hard work and its going to take some time Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe effective and freeYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID19 So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID19 that Im going to be announcing tonight let me give you some clear information about where we standFirst we have conswe have made considerable progressin battling COVID19 When I became President about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated Today over 175 million Americans have that protection Before I took office we hadnt ordered enough vaccine for every American Just weeks in office we did The week before I took office on January 20th of this year over 25000 Americans died that week from COVID19 Last week that grim weekly toll was down 70 percentAnd in the three months before I took office our economy was faltering creating just 50000 jobs a month Were now averaging 700000 new jobs a month in the past three monthsThis progress is real But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office I need to tell you a second factWere in a tough stretch and it could last for a while The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before usWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated we read about we hear about and we see the stories of hospitalized people people on their death beds among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated And its caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80000 different locations we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot And to make matters worse there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID19 Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up theyre ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities This is totally unacceptableThird if you wonder how all this adds up heres the math The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot but one quarter has not gotten any Thats nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated And in a country as large as ours thats 25 percent minority That 25 percent can cause a lot of damageand they areThe unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreitis pancreatitis or cancerAnd fourth I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID19 I know theres a lot of confusion and misinformation But the worlds leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated your risk of severe illness from COVID19 is very low In fact based on available data from the summer only one of out of every 160000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per dayThese are the facts So heres where we stand The path ahead even with the Delta variant is not nearly as bad as last winter But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID19 and a distinct minority of Americans supported by a distinct minority of elected officialsare keeping us from turning the corner These pandemic politics as I refer to are making people sick causing unvaccinated people to die We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal As your President Im announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated to combat those blocking public health My plan also increases testing protects our economy and will make our kids safer in schools It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each thatand each of those actions that you can read more about at WhiteHousegov WhiteHousegovThe measuresthese are going to take time to have full impact But if we implement them I believe and the scientists indicate that in the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans decrease hospitalizations and deaths and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses openFirst we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administrationthe FDA Well last month the FDA granted that approvalSo the time for waiting is over This summer we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives as well as the FDA approval Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July But we need to do more This is not about freedom or personal choice Its about protecting yourself and those around youthe people you work with the people you care about the people you loveMy job as President is to protect all Americans So tonight Im announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a weekSome of the biggest companies are already requiring this United Airlines Disney Tysons Food and even Fox NewsThe bottom line Were going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers Were going to reduce the spread of COVID19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across AmericaMy plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the healthcare field Already Ive announced well be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid because I have that federal authorityTonight Im using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals home healthcare facilities or other medical facilitiesa total of 17 million healthcare workersIf youre seeking care at a health facility you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated Simple Straightforward PeriodNext I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinatedall And Ive signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the sameIf you want to work with the federal government and do business with us get vaccinated If you want to do business with the federal government vaccinate your workforce And tonight Im removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinatedThe Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinatedToday in total the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americanstwo thirds of all workers And for other sectors I issue this appeal To those of you running large entertainment venuesfrom sports arenas to concert venues to movie theatersplease require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entryAnd to the nations family physicians pediatricians GPsgeneral practitionersyoure the most trusted medical voice to your patients You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated Tonight Im asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot America needs your personal involvement in this critical effortAnd my message to unvaccinated Americans is this What more is there to wait for What more do you need to see Weve made vaccinations free safe and convenientThe vaccine has FDA approval Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot Weve been patient but our patience is wearing thin And your refusal has cost all of us So please do the right thing But just dont take it from me listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds taking their final breaths saying If only I had gotten vaccinated If onlyIts a tragedy Please dont let it become yoursThe second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinatedFor the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated I understand your anger at those who havent gotten vaccinated I understand the anxiety about getting a breakthrough caseBut as the science makes clear if youre fully vaccinated youre highly protected from severe illness even if you get COVID19 In fact recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5000 fully vaccinated Americans per dayYoure as safe as possible and were doing everything we can to keep it that waykeep it that way keep you safeThats where boosters come inthe shots that give you even more protection than after your second shotNow I know theres been some confusion about boosters So let me be clear Last month our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yetOf course the decision of which booster shots to give when to start them and who will give them will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease ControlBut while we wait weve done our part Weve bought enough boostersenough booster shotsand the distribution system is ready to administer themAs soon as they are authorized those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across thesites across the country for most Americans at your nearby drug store and for free The third piece of my plan is keepingand maybe the most importantis keeping our children safe and our schools open For any parent it doesnt matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild Trust me I know So let me speak to you directly Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worriesIt comes down to two separate categories children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligibleThe safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated They get vaccinated for a lot of things Thats it Get them vaccinatedAs with adults almost all the serious COVID19 cases were seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12 to 17yearoldsan age group that lags behind in vaccination ratesSo parents please get your teenager vaccinatedWhat about children under the age of 12 who cant get vaccinated yet Well the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home Every parent every teen sibling every caregiver around them should be vaccinated Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than the states with high vaccination rates Now if youre a parent of a young child youre wondering when will it bewhen will it bethe vaccine available for them I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12 We cant take shortcuts with that scientific work But Ive made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible and our nations top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can planNow to the schools We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measureslike testing masking adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for social distancing and vaccinationsthen children can be safe from COVID19 in schoolsToday about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated We should get that to 100 percent My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Departmentbecause I have the authority as President in the federal systemthe Defense Department and the Interior Departmentto get vaccinated Thats authority I possess Tonight Im announcing that well require all of nearly 300000 educators in the federal paid program Head Start program must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngestour youngestmost precious Americans and give parents the comfortAnd tonight Im calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff Some already have done so but we need more to step up Vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new They work Theyre overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children Ill always be on your side Let me be blunt My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions Right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs Talk about bullying in schools If theyll not helpif these governors wont help us beat the pandemic Ill use my power as President to get them out of the way The Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 percent I promise you I will have your back The fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking From the start America has failed to do enough COVID19 testing In order to better detect and control the Delta variant Im taking steps tonight to make testing more available more affordable and more convenient Ill use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests including those that you can use at home While that production is ramping up my administration has worked with top retailers like Walmart Amazon and Krogers and tonight were announcing that no later than next week each of these outlets will start to sell athome rapid test kits at cost for the next three months This is an immediate price reduction for athome test kits for up to 35 percent reductionWell also expandexpand free testing at 10000 pharmacies around the country And well commitwere committing 2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers food banks schools so that every American no matter their income can access free and convenient tests This is important to everyone particularly for a parent or a childwith a child not old enough to be vaccinated Youll be able to test them at home and test those around themIn addition to testing we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID19 Thats why when I came into office I required masks for all federal buildings and on federal lands on airlines and other modes of transportation Todaytonight Im announcing that the Transportation Safety Administrationthe TSAwill double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask If you break the rules be prepared to pay And by the way show some respect The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong its ugly The fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan which we passed early in my administration weve had record job creation for a new administration economic growth unmatched in 40 years We cannot let unvaccinated do this progressundo it turn it back So tonight Im announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery Well be expanding COVID19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs Thats a program thats going to allow small businesses to borrow up to 2 million from the current 500000 to keep going if COVID19 impacts on their sales These lowinterest longterm loans require no repayment for two years and be can used to hire and retain workers purchase inventory or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began Ill also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic Sixth were going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID19 In early July I announced the deployment of surge response teams These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services the CDC the Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management AgencyFEMAto areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID19 Since then the federal government has deployed nearly 1000 staff including doctors nurses paramedics into 18 states Today Im announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that theyll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country Additionally were increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors not conspirconspiracy theorists The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing sefesevere disease Weve already distributed 14 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals Tonight Im announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percentBefore I close let me say this Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus And as we continue to battle COVID19 we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response Well ensure that everyone is reached My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American including enough boosters for every American whos approved to get one We also know this virus transcends borders Thats why even as we execute this plan at home we need to continue fighting the virus overseas continue to be the arsenal of vaccines Were proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries more than all other countries combined including Europe China and Russia combined Thats American leadership on a global stage and thats just the beginningWeve also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccinesPfizer vaccinespurchased to donate to 100 lowerincome countries in need of vaccines And Ill be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this monthAs I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isnt caught flatfooted when a new pandemic comes againas it willnext month Im also going to release the plan in greater detailSo let me close with this We have soweve made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days Even so we remain at a critical moment a critical time We have the tools Now we just have to finish the job with truth with science with confidence and together as one nationLook were the United States of America Theres nothingnot a single thingwere unable to do if we do it together So lets stay togetherGod bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic And may God protect our troopsGet vaccinated
Good afternoon I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps were taking to address the rapidly evolving eventsMy national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency includingand contingencyincluding the rapid collapse were seeing nowIll speak more in a moment about the specific steps were taking but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what Americas interests are in AfghanistanWe went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals get those who attacked us on September 11th 2001 and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us againWe did that We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden and we got him That was a decade ago Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building It was never supposed to be creating a unified centralized democracyOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been preventing a terrorist attack on American homelandIve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorismnot counterinsurgency or nation building Thats why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice PresidentAnd thats why as President I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021not yesterdays threatsToday the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan al Shabaab in Somalia al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula alNusra in Syria ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia These threats warrant our attention and our resourcesWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we dont have a permanent military presenceIf necessary we will do the same in Afghanistan Weve developed counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if neededWhen I came into office I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban Under his agreement US forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1 2021just a little over three months after I took officeUS forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15500 American forces to 2500 troops in country and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001The choice I had to make as your President was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting seasonThere would have been no ceasefire after May 1 There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1 There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan lurching into the third decade of conflict I stand squarely behind my decision After 20 years Ive learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forcesThats why we were still there We were cleareyed about the risks We planned for every contingencyBut I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you The truth is This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipatedSo whats happened Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country The Afghan military collapsed sometimes without trying to fightIf anything the developments of the past week reinforced that ending US military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves We spent over a trillion dollars We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300000 strongincredibly well equippeda force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies We gave them every tool they could need We paid their salaries provided for the maintenance of their air forcesomething the Taliban doesnt have Taliban does not have an air force We provided close air support We gave them every chance to determine their own future What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that futureTheres some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now there is no chance that 1 year1 more year 5 more years or 20 more years of US military boots on the ground wouldve made any differenceAnd heres what I believe to my core It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistans own armed forces would not If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down they would never have done so while US troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for themAnd our true strategic competitorsChina and Russiawould love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitelyWhen I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July we had very frank conversations We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the US military departed to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically They failed to do any of thatI also urged them to engage in diplomacy to seek a political settlement with the Taliban This advice was flatly refused Mr Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight but obviously he was wrongSo Im left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay How many more generations of Americas daughters and sons would you have me send to fight AfghansAfghanistans civil war when Afghan troops will not How many more livesAmerican livesis it worth How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National CemeteryIm clear on my answer I will not repeat the mistakes weve made in the pastthe mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of US forcesThose are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignoreI also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us The scenes were seeing in Afghanistan theyre gutwrenching particularly for our veterans our diplomats humanitarian workers for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan peopleFor those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the countryserve our country in Afghanistanthis is deeply deeply personalIt is for me as well Ive worked on these issues as long as anyone Ive been throughout Afghanistan during this warwhile the war was going onfrom Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar ValleyIve traveled there on four different occasions I met with the people Ive spoken to the leaders I spent time with our troops And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in AfghanistanSo now were fercus sicfocused on what is possible We will continue to support the Afghan people We will lead with our diplomacy our international influence and our humanitarian aidWell continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instabilityWell continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan peopleof women and girlsjust as we speak out all over the worldI have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy not the periphery But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments its with our diplomacy our economic tools and rallying the world to join us Now let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan I was asked to authorizeand I did6000 US troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of US and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of AfghanistanOur troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights Were taking over air traffic control We have safely shut down our embassy and transferred our diplomats Our dipour diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as wellOver the coming days we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in AfghanistanWell also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnelthe civilian personnel of our Allies who are still serving in AfghanistanOperation Allies Refugee Refuge which I announced back in July has already moved 2000 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their families to the United StatesIn the coming days the US military will provide assistance to move more SIVeligible Afghans and their families out of AfghanistanWere also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy US nongovernmental agenciesor the US nongovernmental organizations and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk and US news agenciesI know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghanscivilians sooner Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlierstill hopeful for their country And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering as they said a crisis of confidenceAmerican troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do but it is not without risksAs we carry out this departure we have made it clear to the Taliban If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation the US presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful We will defend our people with devastating force if necessaryOur current military mission will be short in time limited in scope and focused in its objectives Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible And once we have completed this mission we will conclude our military withdrawal We will end Americas longest war after 20 long years of bloodshedThe events were seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable united and secure Afghanistanas known in history as the graveyard of empiresWhat is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future We have to be honest Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many misstepsmade many missteps over the past two decades Im now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistantwo Democrats and two Republicans I will not pass this responsibly onresponsibility on to a fifth PresidentI will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from hereI am President of the United States of America and the buck stops with meI am deeply saddened by the facts we now face But I do not regret my decision to end Americas warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laserfocus on our counterterrorism missions there and in other parts of the worldOur mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden was a successOur decadeslong effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not and I wrote and believed it never could beI cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in anotherin another countrys civil war taking casualties suffering lifeshattering injuries leaving families broken by grief and lossThis is not in our national security interest It is not what the American people want It is not what our troops who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades deserveI made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring Americas military involvement in Afghanistan to an end And while its been hard and messyand yes far from perfectIve honored that commitmentMore importantly I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation that I wasnt going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man I will not do it in AfghanistanI know my decision will be criticized but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United Statesyet another onea fifth one Because its the right oneits the right decision for our people The right one for our brave service members who have risked their lives serving our nation And its the right one for America So thank you May God protect our troops our diplomats and all of the brave Americans serving in harms way
Good afternoon Earlier today I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of US forces and allied forces in AfghanistanWhen I announced our drawdown in April I said we would be out by September and were on track to meet that targetOur military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way prioritizing the safety of our troops as they departOur military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown And in this context speed is safetyAnd thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal no oneno one US forces or any forces havehave been lost Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increased risk of safety to our personnelTo me those risks were unacceptable And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism Thats what they do And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supportedwe are supporting and supporting us as well as they conclude their retrogradeI want to be clear The US military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August We remainwe retain personnel and capacities in the country and we maintain some authorityexcuse me the same authority under which weve been operating for some timeAs I said in April the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 911 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States We achieved those objectives Thats why we wentWe did not go to Afghanistan to nationbuild And its the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their countryTogether with our NATO Allies and partners we have trained and equipped over three hunearly 300000 current serving members of the militaryof the Afghan National Security Force and many beyond that who are no longer serving Add to that hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decadesWe provided our Afghan partners with all the toolslet me emphasize all the tools training and equipment of any modern military We provided advanced weaponry And were going to continue to provide funding and equipment And well ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air forceBut most critically as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserveIn our meeting I also assured Ghani that US support for the people of Afghanistan will endure We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance including speaking out for the rights of women and girlsI intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airportAnd were going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violenceIve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solutionTo be clearto be clear Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement Well work with them and they should help step up their efforts as wellWere going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans including Markexcuse meFre FrerichsI want to pronounce the name correctly I misI misspokeso that he can return to his family safelyWere also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work sidebyside with US forces including interpreters and translatorssince were no longer going to have military there after this were not going to need them and they have no jobswho are also going to be vital to our efforts so theyand theyve been very vitaland so their families are not exposed to danger as wellWeve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United StatesSince I was inaugurated on January 20th weve already approved 2500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States Up to now fewer than half have exercised their right to do that Half have gotten on aircraft and comcommercial flights and come and the other half believe they want to stayat least thus farWere working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the US military mission concludes so that if they choose they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their US visas are being processedThe operation has identified US facilities outside of the continental United States as well as in third countries to host our Afghan allies if they chif they so choose And starting this month were going to begin to rererelocwere going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leaveWe have a point person in the White House and at the State Departmentled task force coordinating all these effortsBut our message to those women and men is clear There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose and we will stand with you just as you stood with usWhen I made the decision to end the US military involvement in Afghanistan I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely I made the decision with clear eyes and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updatesBut for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year I ask them to consider the lessons of recent historyIn 2011 the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014 In 2014 some argued One more year So we kept fighting and we kept taking casualties In 2015 the same And on and onNearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitelyIts up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their countryOthers are more direct Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghanin Afghanistan indefinitely In doing so they point to the fact that wewe have not taken losses in this last year so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimalBut that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office The Taliban was at its strongest milis at its strongest militarily since 2001The number of US forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum And the United States in the last administration made an agreement that thewith the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this pastof this year Thats what I inherited That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against US forcesIf in April I had instead announced that the United States was going to backgoing back on that agreement made by the last administrationthat the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable futurethe Taliban would have again begun to target our forcesThe status quo was not an option Staying would have meant US troops taking casualties American men and women back in the middle of a civil war And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troopsOnce that agreement with the Taliban had been made staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possibleSo let me ask those who wanted us to stay How many morehow many thousands more of Americas daughters and sons are you willing to risk How long would you have them stayAlready we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well Would you send your own son or daughterAfter 20 yearsa trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces 2448 Americans killed 20722 more wounded and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental healthI will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcomeThe United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago We need to meet the threats where they are todayToday the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan So we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher in South Asia the Middle East and AfricaBut make no mistake Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from AfghanistanWe are developing a counterterrorism overthehorizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and act quickly and decisively if neededAnd we also need to focus on shoring up Americas core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determinedetermine our futureWe have to defeat COVID19 at home and around the world make sure were better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threatWe need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergencemerging technologiesWe need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate changeAnd we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years not the last 20 yearsFinally I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the US military and civilian personnel serving alongside our Allies and partners have made over the last two decades in AfghanistanI want to honor the significance of what theyve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planetand Ive been almost throughout that entire country ensuring there hasnt been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years taking out Bin LadenI want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this warWell never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their countryWere ending Americas longest war but well always always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in itMay God bless you all and may God protect our troops Thank you

we have one of the most talented members of Congress And so if I didnt walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswomanapplauseimmediately that was How are you Rev Good to see youWeve got a distinguished group of people here and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand whats happening hereAnd to all of the descendants here today and to the community and civil rights leaders and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forgetYou know theres a verse in First Corinthians that says For now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now I know in part then I shall know fullyIt isI just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here AndapplauseI mean that sincerely Thank youAnd if I didnt say what my father would insist on please excuse my back I apologizeBut the tourin the tour I met Mother Randle whos only 56 107 years old God love her And Mother Fletcher whos 67 106 years old And her brotherher brother Van Ellis whos 100 years old And he looks like hes 60 Thank you for spending so much time with me I really mean it It was a great honor A genuine honorYou are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly But no longer Now your story will be known in full viewThe events we speak of today took place 100 years ago And yet Im the first President in 100 years ever to come to TulsaapplauseI say that not as a compliment about me but to think about ita hundred years and the first President to be here during that entire time and in this place in this ground to acknowledge the truth of what took place hereFor much too long the history of what took place here was told in silence cloaked in darkness But just because history is silent it doesnt mean that it did not take place And while darkness can hide much it erases nothing It erases nothing Some injustices are so heinous so horrific so grievous they cant be buried no matter how hard people tryAnd so it is here Onlyonly with truth can come healing and justice and repair Only with truth facing it But that isnt enough First we have to see hear and give respect to Mother Randle Mother Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis To all those lost so many years ago to all the descendants of those who suffered to this communitythats why were here to shine a light to make sure America knows the story in fullMay 1921 Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsaa boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontierOn the north side across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law they built something of their own worthyworthy of their talent and their ambition Greenwooda community a way of life Black doctors and lawyers pastors teachers running hospitals law practices libraries churches schoolsBlack veterans like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to who foughtvolunteered and fought and came home and still faced such prejudice Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War

just a few months old The children of former sharecroppers when they went to bed at night in Greenwood Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealthnot real wealth but a different wealtha wealth in culture and community and heritage But one nightone night changed everything Everything changed While Greenwood was a community to itself it was not separated from the outsideIt wasnt everyone but there was enough hate resentment and vengeance in the community Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equalNative Americans Asian Americans Hispanic Americans Black Americans A belief enforced by law by badge by hood and by noose And it speaks to thatlit the fuse It lit it by the spark that it provideda fuse of furywas an innocent interaction that turned into an ina terrible terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenagerA white mob of 1000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held ready to do what still occurred lynch that young man that night But 75 Black men including Black veterans arrived to stand guard Words were exchanged Then a scuffle Then shots fired Hell was unleashed Literal hell was unleashed Through the night and into the morning the mob terrorized Greenwood Torches and guns Shooting at will A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside An elderly couple knelt by their bed praying to God with their heart and their soul when they were shot in the back of their headsPrivate planesprivate planesdropping explosivesthe first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in TulsaEight of Greenwoods nearly two dozen churches burned like Mt Zionacross the street at Vernon AMEMother Randle said it was like war Mother Fletcher says all these years later she still sees Black bodies aroundThe Greenwood newspaper publisher AJ Smitherton sicexcuse meSmitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night And heres the poem He said Kill them burn them set the pace teach them how to keep their place Reign of murder theft and plunder was the order of the night Thats what he remembered in the poem that he wroteOne hundred years ago at this hour on this first day of June smoke darkened the Tulsa sky rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember razed and in rubbleLess than 24 hoursin less than 24 hours 1100 Black homes and businesses were lost Insurance companiesthey had insurance many of themrejected claims of damage Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless placed in internment campsAs I was told today they were told Dont you mention you were ever in a camp or well come and get you Thats what survivors told meYet no oneno arrests of the mob were made None No proper accounting of the dead The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people Thats all Thirtysix peopleBut based on studies records and accounts the likelihoodthe likely number is much more in the multiple of hundreds Untold bodies dumped into mass graves Families who at the time waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closureBut you know as we speak the processthe process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started And at this moment Id like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers the mothers the sisters sons and daughters friends of God and Greenwood They deserve dignity and they deserve our respect May their souls rest in peacePause for a moment of silenceMy fellow Americans this was not a riot This was a massacreapplauseamong the worst in our history but not the only one And for too long forgotten by our historyAs soon as it happened there was a clear effort to erase it from our memoryour collective memoriesfrom the news and everyday conversations For a long time schools in Tulsa didnt even teach it let alone schools elsewhereAnd most people didnt realize that a century ago a second Ku Klux Klan had been foundedthe second Ku Klux Klan had been foundedA friend of mine Jon MeachamI had writtenwhen I said I was running to restore the soul of America he wrote a book called The Soul of Americanot because of what I said And theres a picture about page 160 in his book showing over 30000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia Reverendpointed hats the robesmarching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC Jesse you know all about this WashinWashington DCIf my memory is correct there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan There were five if Im not mistakenit could have been seven I think it was fivemembers of the United States Senateopen members of the Klan Multiple governors who were open members of the KlanMost people didnt realize that a century ago the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me who were Catholic It wasnt about African Americans then it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute ChristianityThe flames from those burning crosses torched every regionregion of the country Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan and they werent even embarrassed by it they were proud of itAnd that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesnt impact us today because it does still impact us todayWe cant just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know We should know the good the bad everything Thats what great nations do They come to terms with their dark sides And were a great nationThe only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild I come here to help fill the silence because in silence wounds deepen And onlyas painful as it is only in remembrance do wounds heal We just have to choose to rememberWe memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be so it cant be erased We know here in this hallowed place we simply cant bury pain and trauma foreverAnd at some point there will be a reckoning an inflection point like were facing right now as a nationWhat many people hadnt seen before or haor simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer You see it in so many places And theres greater recognition that for too long weve allowed a narrowed cramped view of the promise of this nation to festerthe view that America is a zerosum game where there is only one winner If you succeed I fail If you get ahead I fall behind If you get a job I lose mine And maybe worst of all If I hold you down I lift myself up instead of If you do well we all do well We see that in GreenwoodThis story isnt about the loss of life but a loss of living of wealth and prosterity prosperity and possibilities that still reverberates todayMother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards as a domestic workerMr Van Ellis has shared how even after enlisting and serving in World War Two he still came home to struggle with a segregated AmericaImagine all those hotels and dinners diners and momandpop shops that could beenhave been passed down this past hundred years Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood financial security and generational wealthIf you come from backgrounds like mymy familya workingclass middleclass familythe only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes Imagine what they contributed then and what they couldve contributed all these years Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years what that wouldve meant for all of Tulsa including the white communityWhile the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre it didnt last Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships A highway was built right through the heart of the community Lisa I was talking about our west sidewhat 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military after Dr King was murdered The communitycutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change Thats what Vice President Harris and I are focused on along with our entire administration including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge who is here today Because today were announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community The first is My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family And I might addand I need help if you have an answer to this I cant figure this one out Congressman Horsford But if you live in a Black community and theres another one on the other side of the highwayits a white community its thebuilt by the same builder and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community yourecan pay more for your auto insurance Shockingly the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago Lower today Thats wrong And were committing to changing thatJust imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into thatinto that home and provide for their familiesSecond small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities As President my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers to installing railings in federal buildings to professional servicesWe have a thing calledI wont go into it all because theres not enough time now But Im determined to use every taxpayers dollar that is assigned to me to spend going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri to build American products And as part of that Im going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small disadvantaged businesses including Black and brown small businessesRight now it calls for 10 percent Im going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent inaudible I have the authority to do that Just imagine if instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communitiesThatthe data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding given the chance as white entrepreneurs are But they dont have lawyers They dont havetheythey dont have accountants but they have great ideas Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make And I promise you thats why I set up thea national Small Business Administration thats much broader Because theyre going to get those loans Instead of consigning millions of American children to underresourced schools lets give each and every child three and four years old access to schoolnot daycare school In the last 10 years studies have been done by all the great universities It shows that if increased by 56 percent the possibility of a childno matter what background they come from no matter whatif they start school at three years old they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their livesAnd lets unlock more thanan incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nations Historically Black Colleges and Universities I have a 5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and highdemand fields to compete for the goodpaying jobs in industries likeof the future like cybersecurityThe reason why they donttheirtheir students are equally able to learn as well and get the goodpaying job that start at 90 and 100000 bucks But they dont havethey dont have the backthey dont have the money to provide and build those laboratories So guess what Theyre going to get the money to build those laboratories So instead of just talking about infrastructure lets get about theabout the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways filling the sidewalks and cracks installing streetlights and highspeed Internet creating spacespace to live and work and play safelyLets ensure access to healthcare clean water clean air nearby grocery storesstock the fresh vegetables and food thatapplausein fact deal withI mean these are all things we can doDoes anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments The rich will be just as well off The middle class will do better and everybody will do better Its about goodpaying jobs financial stability and being able to build some generational wealth Its about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world which is now outcompeting usBut just as fundamental as any of these investments Ive discussedthis may be the most fundamental the right to vote The right to vote A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did but I knew him On his deathbed like many I called John to speak to him But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing He died I think about 25 hours later But you know what John said He called the right to vote precious almost sacred He said The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic societyThis sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like Ive never seeneven though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyerwith an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long long time Its simply unAmerican It is not however sadly unprecedented The creed We Shall Overcome is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybodyThe obstacle to procto progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge We saw it in the 60s but with the current assault its not just an echo of a distant history In 2020 we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote restrictive laws lawsuits threats of intimidation voter purges and more We resolved to overcome it all and we did More Americans voted in the last election than anyin the midst of a pandemicthan any election in American history You got voters registered You got voters to the polls The rule of law held Democracy prevailed We overcame But today let me be unequivocal Ive been engaged in this work my whole career and were going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again I will have more to say about this at a later datethe truly unprecedented assault on our democracy an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results But today as for the act of voting itself I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters And in JuneJune should be a month of action on Capitol Hill I hear all the folks on TV saying Why doesnt Biden get this done Well because Biden only has a majority of effectively four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends But were not giving up Earlier this year the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy The Senate will take it up later this month and Im going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passageThe House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act which iswhich is criticalapplauseto providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote To signify the importance of our efforts today Im asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them among her many other responsibilities With her leadership and your support were going to overcome again I promise you But its going to take a hell of a lot of work And finally we have toand finally we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television NeoNazis white supremacists the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torchesthe veins bulging on theiras they were screaming Remember Just close your eyes and picture what it wasWell Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th 6th it broke her hearta mob of violent white extremiststhugs Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years agoLook around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans Hate that never goes away Hate only hidesJesse I think I mentioned this to you I thought after you guys pushed through with Dr King the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights ActI thought we moved But what I didnt realizeI thought we had made enormous progress and I was so proud to be a little part of it But you know what Rev I didnt realize hate is never defeated it only hides It hides And given a little bit of oxygenjust a little bit oxygenby its leaders it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again as if it never went away And so folks we cantwe must not give hate a safe harbor As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress According to the intelligence community terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today Not ISIS not al Qaedawhite supremacists Thats not me thats the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration Two weeks ago I signed into law the COVID19 Hate Crimes Act which the House had passed and the Senate My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty sicof bigotry But Im going to close where I started To Mother Randle Mother Fletcher Mr Van Ellis to the descendants and to all survivors Thank you Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today Thank you for your courage Thank you for your commitment And thank your children and your grandchildren and your uncand your nieces and your nephews To see and learn from you is a gifta genuine gift Dr John Hope Franklin one of Americas greatest historiansTulsas proud son whose father was a Greenwood survivorsaid and I quote Whatever you do it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hopeOn this sacred and solemn day may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spiritthe spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future that helps us see face to face a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nationIve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today I mean that And the reason is because of this new generation of young people Theyre the best educated theyre the least prejudiced the most open generation in American history And although I have no scientific basis of what Im about to say but those of you who are over 50how often did you ever seehow often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples Not a joke I challenge youfind today when you turn on the stationssit on one station for two hours And I dont know how many commercials youll seeeight to fivetwo to three out of five have mixedrace couples in them Thats not by accident Theyre selling soap man Not a joke Remember ol Pat Caddell He used to say You want to know whats happening in American culture Watch advertising because they want to sell what they have We have hope in folks like you honey I really mean it We have hope But weve got to give them support We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didnt care deeply about this You sure in the devil didnt come to hear me speak But I really mean it I really mean it Lets not give up man Lets not give up As the old saying goes Hope springs eternal I know weve talked a lot about famous people but Immy colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets They think I did it because Im Irish They think I did it because we Irishwe have a little chip on our shoulder A little bit sometimes Thats not why I did it I did it because theyre the best poets in the world You can smile its okay Its true There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called The Cure at TroySeamus Heaney And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people It said History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime the longedfor tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme Lets make it rhyme Thank you

rising anew choosing hope over fear truth over lies and light over darknessAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal America is ready for takeoff in my view Were working again dreaming again discovering again and leading the world againWe have shown each other and the world that theres no quit in AmericanoneOne hundred days ago Americas house was on fire We had to act And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi MalorMajority Leader Schumer and the overwhelming support of the American peopleDemocrats independents and Republicanswe did actTogether we passed the American Rescue Planone of the most consequential rescue packages in American history Were already seeing the results Were already seeing the results After I promised wed get 100 million COVID19 vaccine shots into peoples arms in 100 days we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days Thanks to all the help of all of you were marshallingwith your help everyones helpwere marshalling every federal resource Weve gotten vaccines to nearly 40000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached Were setting up community vaccination sites

diseasewrote to me said shes worriedthat she was worrying about bringing the virus home She said she then got vaccinated at aat a large site in her car She said she sat in her car when she got vaccinated and just criedcried out of joy and cried out of reliefParents see the smiles on their kids faces for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and

know theres stillyou all know it you know it better than any group of Americanstheres still more work to do to beat this virus We cant let our guard downBut tonight I can say it Because of you the American people our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievementslogistical achievements this country has ever seenWhat else have we done in those first 100 daysWe kept our commitmentDemocrats and Republicansof sending 1400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households Weve already sent more than one160 million checks out the door Its making the difference You all know it when you go home For many people its making all the difference in the worldA single mom in Texas who wrote to me she said she couldnt work but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartmentA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctorsomething she said she put off for months because she didnt have the money One of the defining images at least from my perspective of this crisis has been cars lined upcars lined up for miles And notnot people who just barely ever start those carsnice cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunkI dont know about you but I didnt ever think Id see that in America And all of this is through no fault of their own No fault of their own these people are in this positionThats why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger and hunger is down sharply already Were also providing rental assistanceyou all know this but the American people I want to make sure they understandkeeping people from being evicted from their homes providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the jobDuring these 100 days an additional 800000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that800000 in that periodWere making one of the largest onetime ever investmentseverin improving healthcare for veterans Critical investments to address the opioid crisis And maybe most importantly thanks to the American Rescue Plan were on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year And in the process while this was all going on the economy created more than 1300000 new jobs in 100 daysmore jobs in the firstapplausemore jobs in the first 100 days than any President on recordThe International Monetary Fundapplausethe International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decadesAmerica is movingmoving forwardbut we cant stop now Were in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century Were at a great inflection point in historyWe have to do more than just build back betterI mean build back We have to build back better We have to compete more strenuously than we haveThroughout our history if you think about it public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed Americaour attitudes as well as our opportunitiesThe transcontinental railroad the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of AmericaUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunityScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moonnow were on Mars discovering vaccines gave us the Internet and so much moreThese are the investments we made together as one country and investments that only the government was in a position to make Time and again they propel us into the futureThats why I proposed the American Jobs Plana onceinageneration investment in America itself This is the largest jobs plan since World War TwoIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure jobs modernizing our roads bridges highways jobs building ports and airports rail corridors transit lines Its clean water And today up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them including in drinking watera clear and present danger to our childrens healthThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nations lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water And in the process it will create thousands and thousands of goodpaying jobs It creates jobs connecting every American with highspeed Internet including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesnt have itThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21stcentury economyAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort if she would THE VICE PRESIDENT Of courseTHE PRESIDENTbecause I know it will get done It creates jobs building a modern power grid Our grids are vulnerable to storms hacks catastrophic failureswith tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter stormsThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid We can do that Look the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careersTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemictwo million And too often because they couldnt get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs helpEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability If you think its not important check out in your own districtDemocrat or RepublicanDemocrat or Republican voters their great concernalmost as much as their childrenis taking care of an elderly loved one who cant be left alone Medicaid contemplated it but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits continuing a cycle of growthFor too long weve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis jobs Jobs Jobs For me when I think climate change I think jobsThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energyefficient buildings and homes Electrical workersIBEW membersinstalling 500000 charging stations along our highways so we can ownapplauseso we can own the electric car market Farmersfarmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it Look but think about it There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines cant be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing No reason None No reason So folks theres no reason why AmericanAmerican workers cant lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries I mean there is no reason We have this capacity We have the brightest besttrained people in the worldThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of goodpaying jobsjobs Americans can raise a family onas my dad would then say with a little breathing roomAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle Buy American Buy AmericanAnd I might note parentheticallyapplausethat does notthat does not violate any trade agreement Its been the law since the 30s Buy American American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs Thats the way its supposed to be and it will be in this administration And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously sic limited It will be American productsNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you So many of youso many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind forgotten in an economy thats so rapidly changing Its frightening I want to speak directly to you Because if you think about it thats what people are most worried about Can I fit inIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come It is ait is an eightyear program These are goodpaying jobs that cant be outsourcedNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree 75 percent dont require an associates degreeThe American Jobs Plan is a bluecollar blueprint to build America Thats what it is And it recognizes something Ive always said in this chamber and the other Good guys and women on Wall Street but Wall Street didnt build this country The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class So thats why Im calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Actthe PRO Actand send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize And by the way while youre thinking about sending things to my desklaughslets raise the minimum wage to 15 No oneno one working 40 hours a weekno one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty lineWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women And while were doing this lets get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as wellequal pay Its been much too long And if youre wondering whether its too long look behind me And finally the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record We will see more technological changeand some of you know more about this than I dowell see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 Thats how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changingAnd were falling behind the competition with the rest of the worldDecades ago we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America2 percent of our gross domestic productin research and development Today Mr Secretary thats less than 1 percent China and other countries are closing in fast We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the futureadvanced batteries biotechnology computer chips clean energyThe Secretary of Defense can tell youand those of you onwho work on national security issues knowthe Defense Department has an agency called DARPAthe Defense Advanced Research Project Agency The people who set up before I came hereand thats been a long time agoto develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security thats their only job And its a semiseparate agency its under the Defense Department Its led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our securityThe National Institute of Healththe NIH I believe should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health And that wouldheres what it would do It would have a singular purpose to develop breakthroughs to prevent detect and treat diseases like Alzheimers diabetes and cancerIll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice Presidentalmost 9 million going to NIH And if you excuse the point of personal privilege Ill never forget you standing and mentioningsaying youd name it after my deceased son It meant a lotBut so many of us have deceased sons daughters and relatives who died of cancer I can think of no more worthy investment I know of nothing that is more bipartisan So lets end cancer as we know it Its within our power Its within our power to do it Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones were talking about have often had bipartisan support in the past Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposalSo lets get to work I wanted to lay out before the Congress my plan before we got into the deep discussions Id like to meet with those who have ideas that are differentthey think are better I welcome those ideas But the rest of the world is not waiting for us I just want to be clear From my perspective doing nothing is not an option Look we cant be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st centurySecretary Blinken can tell you I spent a lot of time with President Xitraveled over 17000 miles with him spent they tell me over 24 hours in private discussions with him When he called to congratulate me we had a twohour discussion Hes deadly earnest about becoming the most significant consequential nation in the world He and othersautocratsthink that democracy cant compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus To win that competition for the future in my view we also need to make a onceinageneration investment in our families and our children Thats why Ive introduced the American Families Plan tonight which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and in turn AmericaFirst is access to a good education When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century it made us the besteducated bestprepared nation in the world Its I believe the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21stin the 20th century But the world has caught up or catching up They are not waiting I would say parenthetically If we were sitting down put a bipartisan committee together and said Okay were going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education I wonder whether wed think as we did in the 20th century that 12 years is enough in the 21st century I doubt it Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st CenturyThats why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America starting as early as we canThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years It shows that adding two years of universal highquality preschool for every threeyearold and fouryearold no matter what background they come from it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduationThe research shows when a young child goes to schoolnot daycarethey are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high schoolWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that you begin to change the dynamic We can do that And well increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities Tribal Colleges MinorityServing Institutions The reason is They dont have the endowments but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity just as capable of learning about metallurgyall the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the futureJill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady She has long saidapplause She has longapplause If Ive heard it once Ive heard it a thousand times Joe any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us Shell be deeply involved in leading this effort Thank you JillSecond thing we need American Families Plan will provide access to quality affordable childcare We guaranteeapplause And Im proposing a legislation to guarantee that low and middleincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for highquality care for children up to the age of 5 The most hardpressed working families wont have to spend a dimeThird the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leavefamily and medical leave Were one of the few industrial countries in the worldapplause No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones a parent a spouse or childAnd fourth the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family Up to a 3000 per child if theyre under over six years of ageI mean excuse meunderover six years of age and 3600 for children over under six years of ageWith two parents two kids thats 7200 in the pockets thats going to help to take care of your family And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare child poverty in half And we can afford it So we did that in the recin thein the last piece of legislation we passed But lets extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025 The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act I know thats really popular on this side of the aisle But lets make that provision permanent so their premiums dont go back up In addition to my Families Plan Im going to work with Congress to address this year other critical priorities for American families The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans protecting people with preexisting conditions protecting womens health And the pandemic has demonstrated how badlyhow badly its needed Lets lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Carein the Affordable Care Act And lets lower prescription drug costs We know how to do this The last President had that as an objective We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America In fact we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in Americanearly three timesfor the same drug nearly three times what other countries pay We have to change that and we can Lets do what weve always talked about for all the years I was down here in thisin this bodyin Congress Lets give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices And by the way that wont justthat wont just help people on Medicare it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone And the money we save which is billions of dollars can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny Its within our power to do it lets do it now Weve talked about it long enough Democrats and Republicans lets get it done this year This is all about a simple premise Healthcare should be a right not a privilege in America So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan I made it clear we can do it without increasing the deficits Lets start with what I will not do I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than 400000 Itsbut its time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share Just their fair share Sometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire but pay your fair shareA recent study shows that 55 of the nations biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year Those 55 corporations made in excess of 40 billion in profit A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas Its not right Were going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well Were going to reward work not just wealth We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americansthose making over 400000 or moreback up to where it was when George W Bush was President when he started 396 percent Thats where it was when George W was President Were going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck Were only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action Three tenths of 1 percent And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes Its estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left right and center Im not looking to punish anybody But I will not add a tax burdenan additional tax burden to the middle class in this country Theyre already paying enough I believe what I propose is fairapplausefiscally responsible and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the countryWhen you hear someone say that they dont want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America ask them Whose taxes you want to raise instead Whose are you going to cut Look the big tax cut of 2017remember it was supposed to pay for itselfthat was how it was soldand generate vast economic growth Instead it added 2 trillion to the deficit It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very topInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs In fact the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history According to one study CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes It used to be in thebelow a hundred The pandemic has only made things worse Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemicworking and middleclass Americans At the same time roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than 1 trillionin the same exact period Let me say it again 650 people increased their wealth by more than 1 trillion during this pandemic And theyre now worth more than 4 trillion My fellow Americans trickledowntrickledown economics has never worked and its time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out You know theres a broad consensus of economistsleft right centerand they agree what Im proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth These are among the highestvalue investments we can make as a nation Ive often said Our greatest strength is the power of our example not just the example of our powerIn my conversations with world leadersand Ive spoken to over 38 40 of them nowIve made it knownIve made it known that America is back And you know what they say The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say We see America is back but for how long But for how longMy fellow Americans we have to show not just that were back but that were back to stay and that we arent going to go it alone Were going to do it by leading with our allies No one nation can deal with all the crises of our timefrom terrorism to nuclear proliferation mass migration cybersecurity climate change as well as experiwhat were experiencing now with pandemics Theres no wall high enough to keep any virus out And our own vaccine supplyas it grows to meet our needs and were meeting themwill become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the worldapplauseand in consequence influenced the world But every American will have access before that occurevery American will have access to be fully covered by COVID19from the vaccines we haveLook the climate crisis is not our fight alone its a global fight The United States accounts as all of you know less than 15 percent of carbon emissions The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent Thats why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accordbecause if we do everything perfectly its not going to ultimately matterI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the worldChina Russia India the European Unionand I said Id do it in my first 100 daysI want to be very blunt about it I hadmy attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus that we are at an inflection point in history And consensusthe consensus is If we act to save the planet we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the worldIf youve watched any of itand you were all busy Im sure you didnt have much timethats what virtually every nation said even the ones that arent doing their fair shareThe investments Ive proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy in my view that benefits the middle class That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy including ChinaIn my discussionsin my discussions with President Xi I told him We welcome the competition Were not looking for conflict But I made absolutely clear that we will defend Americas interests across the board America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries like subsidies from stateto stateowned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual propertyI also told President Xi that well maintain a strong military presence in the IndoPacific just as we do with NATO in Europenot to start a conflict but to prevent one I told him what Ive said to many world leaders that America will not back away from our commitmentsour commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliancesAnd I pointed out to him No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated An American PresidentPresident has to represent the essence of what our country stands for America is an ideathe most unique idea in history We are created all of us equal Its who we are and we cannot walk away from that principle and in fact say were dealing with the American ideaWith regard to Russia I know it concerns some of you but I made very clear to Putin that were not going to seek escaecalaexcexcuse meescalation but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true And they turned out to be true so I responded directly and proportionally to Russias interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business They did both of these things and I told them we would respond and we haveBut we can also cooperate when its in our mutual interest We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms and were working to do it on climate change But he understands we will respondOn Iran and North Koreanuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the worldwere going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through dithrough diplomacy as well as stern deterrenceAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan We haveapplausewe have without hyperbole the greatest fighting force in the history of the world Im the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 911The War in Afghanistan as we remember the debates here were never meant to be multigenerational undertakings of nationbuilding We went to Afghanistan to get terroriststhe terrorists who attacked us on 911and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it If youve been to the upper Kunar Valley youve kind of seen the gates of hell And we delivered justice to bin Laden We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan And after 20 years of valuevalor and sacrifice its time to bring those troops home Look even as we do we will maintain an overthehorizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland And make no mistake In 20 years terrorists hasterrorism has metastasized The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan And those of you in the intelligence committees the foreign relations committee the defense committees you know well We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen Syria Somalia other places in Africa the Middle East and beyond And we wont ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today White supremacy is terrorism Were not going to ignore that eitherMy fellow Americans look we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation It was nearly a year ago before her fathers funeral when I spoke with Gianna Floyd George Floyds young daughter Shes a little tyke so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye And she looked at me and she said My daddy changed the world Well after the conviction of George Floyds murderer we can see how right she was ifif we have the courage to act as a Congress Weve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans Now is our opportunity to make some real progress The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities and they serve them honorably I know them I know they wantapplauseI know they want to help meet this moment as wellMy fellow Americans we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system and to enact police reform in George Floyds name that passed the House already I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate We need to work together to find a consensus But lets get it done next month by the first anniversary of George Floyds death The country supports this reform and Congress should actshould act We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justicereal justice And with the plans outlined tonight we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways a chance to deliver real equitygood jobs good schools affordable housing clean air clean water being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house Real opportunities in the lives of more AmericansBlack white Latino Asian Americans Native AmericansLook I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders You acted decisively And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes weve seen over the past yearthis past year and for too long I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk which I will gladly anxiously signI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans To all transgender Americans watching at home especially young people who are so brave I want you to know your President has your backAnother thing Lets authorize the Violence Against Women Act which has been law for 27 years Twentyseven years ago I wrote it Itll close thethe act that has to be authorized now will close the boyfriend loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers The court order said This is an abuser You cant own a gun Its to close that loophole that existed You know its estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America50 a month Lets pass it and save some lives And I need notI need not tell anyone this but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in AmericaThe flag at the White House was still flying at halfmast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in ColoradoAnd in the week in between those two events 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America250 shot deadI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue In the 90s we passed universal background checks a ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds We beat the NRA Mass shootings and gun violence declined Check out the report in over 10 years But in the early twe2000s the law expired and weve seen daily bloodshed since Im not saying if the law continued we wouldnt see bloodshedMore than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden surrounded by some of the bravest people I knowthe survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violenceI laid out several of the Department of Justice aactions that are being taken toimpact on this epidemic One of them is banning socalled ghost guns These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm The parts have no serial numbers so they show up at crime scenes and they cant be traced The buyers of these ghost gun kits arent required to pass any background check Anyone from a criminal or terrorist could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon thats lethal But no moreAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence but its time for Congress to act as well Look I dont want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns We need a ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines And dont tell me it cant be done We did it before and it workedTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters Theyll tell you theres no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon What do you thinkdeer are wearing Kevlar vests Theyll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldnt be able to buy a gunThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people including many gun owners The country supports reform and isand Congress should actThis shouldnt be a red or blue issue And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute You cant yell Fire in a crowded theater From the very beginning there were certain guns weapons that could not be owned by Americans Certain people could not own those weapons ever Were not changing the Constitution were being reasonable I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue I think its an American issueAnd heres what else we can do Immigration has always been essential to America Lets end our exhausting war over immigration For more than 30 years politicians have talked about immigration reform and weve done nothing about it Its time to fix itOn day one of my presidency I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress If you believe we need to secure the border pass it because it has a lot of money for hightech border security If you believe in a pathway to citizenship pass it so over 11 million undocumented folksthe vast majority are here overstaying visas Pass it We can actuallyif you actually want to solve a problem Ive sent a bill to take a close look at it We have toalso have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing particularly toto our southern border from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador the violence the corruption the gangs and the political instability hunger hurricanes earthquakes natural disastersWhen I was President my Presidentwhen I was Vice President the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave The plan was working but the last administration decided it was not worth itIm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this I have absolute confidence shell get the job done Now look if you dont like my plan lets at least pass what we all agree on Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMersthe young people who have only known America as their home And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and naturalmade violence and disaster As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables Look immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history The country supports immigration reform We should act Lets argue over it lets debate it but lets act And if we truly want to restore the soul of America we need to protect the sacred right to vote Most peopleapplauseMore people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history in the middle of the worst pandemic ever It should be celebrated Instead its being attackedCongress should pass HR 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away The country supports it The Congress should act now Look in closing as we gather here tonight the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol desecrating our democracy remain vivid in all our mindsLives were put at riskmany of your lives Lives were lost Extraordinary courage was summoned The insurrection was an existential crisis a test of whether our democracy could survive And it didBut the struggle is far from over The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent as old as our Republicstill vital today Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us created equal in the image of God have a chance to lead lives of dignity respect and possibilityCan our democracy deliver the mostto the most pressing needs of our people Can our democracy overcome the lies anger hate and fears that have pulled us apartAmericas adversaries the autocrats of the world are betting we cant And I promise you theyre betting we cant They believe were too full of anger and division and rageThey look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy But they are wrong You know it I know it But we have to prove them wrongWe have to prove democracy still worksthat our government still works and we can deliver for our peopleIn our first 100 days together we have acted to restore the peoples faith in democracy to deliver Were vaccinating the nation Were creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs Were delivering real results to people they can see it and feel it in their own livesOpening doors of opportunity guaranteeing some more fairness and justicethats the essence of America Thats democracy in actionOur Constitution opens with the wordsas trite as it soundsWe the People Well its time to remember that We the People are the governmentyou and I Not some force in a distant capital Not some powerful force that we have no control over Its us Its We the PeopleIn another era when our democracy was tested Franklin Roosevelt reminded us In America we do our part We all do our part Thats all Im asking that we do our part all of usIf we do that we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong Autocrats will not win the future We will America will And the future belongs to AmericaAs I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation and I can say with absolute confidence I have never been more confident or optimistic about Americanot because Im President because whats happening with the American peopleWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy pandemic and pain and We the People did not flinchAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail we came together We unitedWith light and hope we summoned a new strength new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century on our way to a union more perfect more prosperous and more just as one people one nation and one AmericaFolks as I told every world leader Ive ever met with over the years its never ever ever been a good bet to bet against America and it still isnt We are the United States of America There is not a single thingnothingnothing beyond our capacity We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together So lets begin to get together God bless you all and may God protect our troops Thank you for your patience 
Thank you Muchas gracias Thank you so much Thank you very muchPresident Castro the people of Cuba thank you so much for the warm welcome that I have received that my family have received and that our delegation has received It is an extraordinary honor to be here today Before I begin please indulge me I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels The thoughts and the prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite we must be together regardless of nationality or race or faith in fighting against the scourge of terrorism We can and will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the worldTo the government and the people of Cuba I want to thank you for the kindness that youve shown to me and Michelle Malia Sasha my motherinlaw Marian Cultivo una rosa blanca In his most famous poem Jose Marti made this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy Today as the President of the United States of America I offer the Cuban people el saludo de paz Havana is only 90 miles from Florida but to get here we had to travel a great distance over barriers of history and ideology barriers of pain and separation The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island to liberate but also to exert control over Cuba Those waters also carried generations of Cuban revolutionaries to the United States where they built support for their cause And that short distance has been crossed by hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles on planes and makeshift rafts who came to America in pursuit of freedom and opportunity sometimes leaving behind everything they owned and every person that they lovedLike so many people in both of our countries my lifetime has spanned a time of isolation between us The Cuban Revolution took place the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya The Bay of Pigs took place the year that I was born The next year the entire world held its breath watching our two countries as humanity came as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war As the decades rolled by our governments settled into a seemingly endless confrontation fighting battles through proxies In a world that remade itself time and again one constant was the conflict between the United States and CubaI have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people I want to be clear The differences between our governments over these many years are real and they are important Im sure President Castro would say the same thing I know because Ive heard him address those differences at length But before I discuss those issues we also need to recognize how much we share Because in many ways the United States and Cuba are like two brothers whove been estranged for many years even as we share the same bloodWe both live in a new world colonized by Europeans Cuba like the United States was built in part by slaves brought here from Africa Like the United States the Cuban people can trace their heritage to both slaves and slaveowners Weve welcomed both immigrants who came a great distance to start new lives in the AmericasOver the years our cultures have blended together Dr Carlos Finlays work in Cuba paved the way for generations of doctors including Walter Reed who drew on Dr Finlays work to help combat Yellow Fever Just as Marti wrote some of his most famous words in New York Ernest Hemingway made a home in Cuba and found inspiration in the waters of these shores We share a national pasttime La Pelota and later today our players will compete on the same Havana field that Jackie Robinson played on before he made his Major League debut And its said that our greatest boxer Muhammad Ali once paid tribute to a Cuban that he could never fight saying that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great Cuban Teofilo Stevenson So even as our governments became adversaries our people continued to share these common passions particularly as so many Cubans came to America In Miami or Havana you can find places to dance the ChaChaCha or the Salsa and eat ropa vieja People in both of our countries have sung along with Celia Cruz or Gloria Estefan and now listen to reggaeton or Pitbull Millions of our people share a common religion a faith that I paid tribute to at the Shrine of our Lady of Charity in Miami a peace that Cubans find in La CachitaFor all of our differences the Cuban and American people share common values in their own lives A sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride A profound love of family A passion for our children a commitment to their education And thats why I believe our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration as just one chapter in a longer story of family and of friendshipBut we cannot and should not ignore the very real differences that we have about how we organize our governments our economies and our societies Cuba has a oneparty system the United States is a multiparty democracy Cuba has a socialist economic model the United States is an open market Cuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state the United States is founded upon the rights of the individualDespite these differences on December 17th 2014 President Castro and I announced that the United States and Cuba would begin a process to normalize relations between our countries Since then we have established diplomatic relations and opened embassies Weve begun initiatives to cooperate on health and agriculture education and law enforcement Weve reached agreements to restore direct flights and mail service Weve expanded commercial ties and increased the capacity of Americans to travel and do business in CubaAnd these changes have been welcomed even though there are still opponents to these policies But still many people on both sides of this debate have asked Why now Why nowThere is one simple answer What the United States was doing was not working We have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth A policy of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people instead of helping them And Ive always believed in what Martin Luther King Jr called the fierce urgency of now we should not fear change we should embrace it That leads me to a bigger and more important reason for these changes Creo en el pueblo Cubano I believe in the Cuban people This is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people And today I want to share with you my vision of what our future can be I want the Cuban people especially the young people to understand why I believe that you should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insists that things are better than they really are or the blind optimism that says all your problems can go away tomorrow Hope that is rooted in the future that you can choose and that you can shape and that you can build for your country Im hopeful because I believe that the Cuban people are as innovative as any people in the worldIn a global economy powered by ideas and information a countrys greatest asset is its people In the United States we have a clear monument to what the Cuban people can build its called Miami Here in Havana we see that same talent in cuentapropistas cooperatives and old cars that still run El Cubano inventa del aire Cuba has an extraordinary resource a system of education which values every boy and every girl And in recent years the Cuban government has begun to open up to the world and to open up more space for that talent to thrive In just a few years weve seen how cuentapropistas can succeed while sustaining a distinctly Cuban spirit Being selfemployed is not about becoming more like America its about being yourselfLook at Sandra Lidice Aldama who chose to start a small business Cubans she said can innovate and adapt without losing our identityour secret is in not copying or imitating but simply being ourselvesLook at Papito Valladeres a barber whose success allowed him to improve conditions in his neighborhood I realize Im not going to solve all of the worlds problems he said But if I can solve problems in the little piece of the world where I live it can ripple across HavanaThats where hope begins with the ability to earn your own living and to build something you can be proud of Thats why our policies focus on supporting Cubans instead of hurting them Thats why we got rid of limits on remittances so ordinary Cubans have more resources Thats why were encouraging travel which will build bridges between our people and bring more revenue to those Cuban small businesses Thats why weve opened up space for commerce and exchanges so that Americans and Cubans can work together to find cures for diseases and create jobs and open the door to more opportunity for the Cuban people As President of the United States Ive called on our Congress to lift the embargo It is an outdated burden on the Cuban people Its a burden on the Americans who want to work and do business or invest here in Cuba Its time to lift the embargo But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba It should be easier to open a business here in Cuba A worker should be able to get a job directly with companies who invest here in Cuba Two currencies shouldnt separate the type of salaries that Cubans can earn The Internet should be available across the island so that Cubans can connect to the wider world applause and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human historyTheres no limitation from the United States on the ability of Cuba to take these steps Its up to you And I can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depends upon education health care and environmental protection But it also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas If you cant access information online if you cannot be exposed to different points of view you will not reach your full potential And over time the youth will lose hopeI know these issues are sensitive especially coming from an American President Before 1959 some Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit ignored poverty enabled corruption And since 1959 weve been shadowboxers in this battle of geopolitics and personalities I know the history but I refuse to be trapped by it Ive made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people We will not impose our political or economic system on you We recognize that every country every people must chart its own course and shape its own model But having removed the shadow of history from our relationship I must speak honestly about the things that I believe the things that we as Americans believe As Marti said Liberty is the right of every man to be honest to think and to speak without hypocrisySo let me tell you what I believe I cant force you to agree but you should know what I think I believe that every person should be equal under the law Every child deserves the dignity that comes with education and health care and food on the table and a roof over their heads I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear applause to organize and to criticize their government and to protest peacefully and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly And yes I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections Not everybody agrees with me on this Not everybody agrees with the American people on this But I believe those human rights are universal I believe they are the rights of the American people the Cuban people and people around the worldNow theres no secret that our governments disagree on many of these issues Ive had frank conversations with President Castro For many years he has pointed out the flaws in the American system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination wars abroad Thats just a sample He has a much longer list But heres what the Cuban people need to understand I welcome this open debate and dialogue Its good Its healthy Im not afraid of itWe do have too much money in American politics But in America its still possible for somebody like me a child who was raised by a single mom a child of mixed race who did not have a lot of money to pursue and achieve the highest office in the land Thats whats possible in America We do have challenges with racial bias in our communities in our criminal justice system in our society the legacy of slavery and segregation But the fact that we have open debates within Americas own democracy is what allows us to get better In 1959 the year that my father moved to America it was illegal for him to marry my mother who was white in many American states When I first started school we were still struggling to desegregate schools across the American South But people organized they protested they debated these issues they challenged government officials And because of those protests and because of those debates and because of popular mobilization Im able to stand here today as an AfricanAmerican and as President of the United States That was because of the freedoms that were afforded in the United States that we were able to bring about change Im not saying this is easy Theres still enormous problems in our society But democracy is the way that we solve them Thats how we got health care for more of our people Thats how we made enormous gains in womens rights and gay rights Thats how we address the inequality that concentrates so much wealth at the top of our society Because workers can organize and ordinary people have a voice American democracy has given our people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and enjoy a high standard of living Now there are still some tough fights It isnt always pretty the process of democracy Its often frustrating You can see that in the election going on back home But just stop and consider this fact about the American campaign thats taking place right now You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican Party running against the legacy of a black man who is President while arguing that theyre the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a Democratic Socialist and applause Who would have believed that back in 1959 Thats a measure of our progress as a democracy So heres my message to the Cuban government and the Cuban people The ideals that are the starting point for every revolution Americas revolution Cubas revolution the liberation movements around the world those ideals find their truest expression I believe in democracy Not because American democracy is perfect but precisely because were not And we like every country need the space that democracy gives us to change It gives individuals the capacity to be catalysts to think in new ways and to reimagine how our society should be and to make them better Theres already an evolution taking place inside of Cuba a generational change Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down but Im appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up build something new El futuro de Cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo Cubano And to President Castro who I appreciate being here today I want you to know I believe my visit here demonstrates you do not need to fear a threat from the United States And given your commitment to Cubas sovereignty and selfdetermination I am also confident that you need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people and their capacity to speak and assemble and vote for their leaders In fact Im hopeful for the future because I trust that the Cuban people will make the right decisionsAnd as you do Im also confident that Cuba can continue to play an important role in the hemisphere and around the globe and my hope is is that you can do so as a partner with the United StatesWeve played very different roles in the world But no one should deny the service that thousands of Cuban doctors have delivered for the poor and suffering Last year American health care workers and the US military worked sidebyside with Cubans to save lives and stamp out Ebola in West Africa I believe that we should continue that kind of cooperation in other countriesWeve been on the different side of so many conflicts in the Americas But today Americans and Cubans are sitting together at the negotiating table and we are helping the Colombian people resolve a civil war thats dragged on for decades That kind of cooperation is good for everybody It gives everyone in this hemisphere hopeWe took different journeys to our support for the people of South Africa in ending apartheid But President Castro and I could both be there in Johannesburg to pay tribute to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela And in examining his life and his words Im sure we both realize we have more work to do to promote equality in our own countries to reduce discrimination based on race in our own countries And in Cuba we want our engagement to help lift up the Cubans who are of African descent applause whove proven that theres nothing they cannot achieve when given the chanceWeve been a part of different blocs of nations in the hemisphere and we will continue to have profound differences about how to promote peace security opportunity and human rights But as we normalize our relations I believe it can help foster a greater sense of unity in the Americas todos somos Americanos From the beginning of my time in office Ive urged the people of the Americas to leave behind the ideological battles of the past We are in a new era I know that many of the issues that Ive talked about lack the drama of the past And I know that part of Cubas identity is its pride in being a small island nation that could stand up for its rights and shake the world But I also know that Cuba will always stand out because of the talent hard work and pride of the Cuban people Thats your strength Cuba doesnt have to be defined by being against the United States any more than the United States should be defined by being against Cuba Im hopeful for the future because of the reconciliation thats taking place among the Cuban peopleI know that for some Cubans on the island there may be a sense that those who left somehow supported the old order in Cuba Im sure theres a narrative that lingers here which suggests that Cuban exiles ignored the problems of preRevolutionary Cuba and rejected the struggle to build a new future But I can tell you today that so many Cuban exiles carry a memory of painful and sometimes violent separation They love Cuba A part of them still considers this their true home Thats why their passion is so strong Thats why their heartache is so great And for the Cuban American community that Ive come to know and respect this is not just about politics This is about family the memory of a home that was lost the desire to rebuild a broken bond the hope for a better future the hope for return and reconciliationFor all of the politics people are people and Cubans are Cubans And Ive come here Ive traveled this distance on a bridge that was built by Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits I first got to know the talent and passion of the Cuban people in America And I know how they have suffered more than the pain of exile they also know what its like to be an outsider and to struggle and to work harder to make sure their children can reach higher in AmericaSo the reconciliation of the Cuban people the children and grandchildren of revolution and the children and grandchildren of exile that is fundamental to Cubas future You see it in Gloria Gonzalez who traveled here in 2013 for the first time after 61 years of separation and was met by her sister Llorca You recognized me but I didnt recognize you Gloria said after she embraced her sibling Imagine that after 61 yearsYou see it in Melinda Lopez who came to her familys old home And as she was walking the streets an elderly woman recognized her as her mothers daughter and began to cry She took her into her home and showed her a pile of photos that included Melindas baby picture which her mother had sent 50 years ago Melinda later said So many of us are now getting so much backYou see it in Cristian Miguel Soler a young man who became the first of his family to travel here after 50 years And meeting relatives for the first time he said I realized that family is family no matter the distance between usSometimes the most important changes start in small places The tides of history can leave people in conflict and exile and poverty It takes time for those circumstances to change But the recognition of a common humanity the reconciliation of people bound by blood and a belief in one another thats where progress begins Understanding and listening and forgiveness And if the Cuban people face the future together it will be more likely that the young people of today will be able to live with dignity and achieve their dreams right here in Cuba The history of the United States and Cuba encompass revolution and conflict struggle and sacrifice retribution and now reconciliation It is time now for us to leave the past behind It is time for us to look forward to the future together un future de esperanza And it wont be easy and there will be setbacks It will take time But my time here in Cuba renews my hope and my confidence in what the Cuban people will do We can make this journey as friends and as neighbors and as family together Si se puede Muchas gracias
Tonight marks the eighth year that Ive come here to report on the State of the Union And for this final one Im going to try to make it a little shorter I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa Ive been there Ill be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips And I understand that because its an election season expectations for what we will achieve this year are low But Mr Speaker I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform applause and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse So who knows we might surprise the cynics againBut tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead Dont worry Ive got plenty from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done Fixing a broken immigration system Protecting our kids from gun violence Equal pay for equal work Paid leave Raising the minimum wage All these things still matter to hardworking families Theyre still the right thing to do And I wont let up until they get doneBut for my final address to this chamber I dont want to just talk about next year I want to focus on the next five years the next 10 years and beyond I want to focus on our futureWe live in a time of extraordinary change change thats reshaping the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world Its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs but also economic disruptions that strain working families It promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away Its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality And whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate America has been through big changes before wars and depression the influx of new immigrants workers fighting for a fair deal movements to expand civil rights Each time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control And each time we overcame those fears We did not in the words of Lincoln adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past Instead we thought anew and acted anew We made change work for us always extending Americas promise outward to the next frontier to more people And because we did because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril we emerged stronger and better than beforeWhat was true then can be true now Our unique strengths as a nation our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to comeIn fact its that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible Its how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations Its how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we loveBut such progress is not inevitable Its the result of choices we make together And we face such choices right now Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear turning inward as a nation turning against each other as a people Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are in what we stand for in the incredible things that we can do togetherSo lets talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next President is or who controls the next CongressFirst how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy Second how do we make technology work for us and not against us especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change Third how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman And finally how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us and not whats worstLet me start with the economy and a basic fact The United States of America right now has the strongest most durable economy in the world Were in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history More than 14 million new jobs the strongest two years of job growth since the 90s an unemployment rate cut in half Our auto industry just had its best year ever Thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly 900000 new jobs in the past six yearsAnd weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequarters Anyone claiming that Americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction Now what is true and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious is that the economy has been changing in profound ways changes that started long before the Great Recession hit changes that have not let upToday technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition As a result workers have less leverage for a raise Companies have less loyalty to their communities And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very topAll these trends have squeezed workers even when they have jobs even when the economy is growing Its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty harder for young people to start their careers tougher for workers to retire when they want to And although none of these trends are unique to America they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shotFor the past seven years our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody Weve made progress But we need to make more And despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agreeWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates to new highs boosted graduates in fields like engineering In the coming years we should build on that progress by providing PreK for all and applause offering every student the handson computer science and math classes that make them jobready on day one We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids And we have to make college affordable for every American No hardworking student should be stuck in the redWeve already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrowers income And thats good But now weve actually got to cut the cost of college Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that and Im going to keep fighting to get that started this year Its the right thing to do But a great education isnt all we need in this new economy We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security Its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber For everyone else especially folks in their 40s and 50s saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher Americans understand that at some point in their careers in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain But they shouldnt lose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the processThats why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever We shouldnt weaken them we should strengthen them And for Americans short of retirement basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today That by the way is what the Affordable Care Act is all about Its about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far And in the process health care inflation has slowedAnd our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became lawNow Im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon A little applause right there Just a guess But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security Say a hardworking American loses his job we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him If that new job doesnt pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills And even if hes going from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him Thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybodyI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance a hand up And Id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers who dont have children But there are some areas where we just have to be honest it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations And its an honest disagreement and the American people have a choice to makeI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed There is red tape that needs to be cut There you go Yes But after years now of record corporate profits working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense Middleclass families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis recklessness on Wall Street did Immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns Its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts The point is I believe that in this new economy workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice not less The rules should work for them And Im not alone in this This year I plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders And I want to spread those best practices across America Thats part of a brighter future In fact it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challengesSixty years ago when the Russians beat us into space we didnt deny Sputnik was up there We didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget We built a space program almost overnight And 12 years later we were walking on the moon Now that spirit of discovery is in our DNA America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world Thats who we areAnd over the past seven years weve nurtured that spirit Weve protected an open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome Americans online Weve launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day But we can do so much moreLast year Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshotAmerica can cure cancer Last month he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade So tonight Im announcing a new national effort to get it done And because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years Im putting Joe in charge of Mission Control For the loved ones weve all lost for the families that we can still save lets make America the country that cures cancer once and for allMedical research is critical We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources Look if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it You will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military most of Americas business leaders the majority of the American people almost the entire scientific community and 200 nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it But even if even if the planet wasnt at stake even if 2014 wasnt the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future Listen seven years ago we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history Here are the results In fields from Iowa to Texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier conventional power On rooftops from Arizona to New York solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average Were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy something by the way that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support And meanwhile weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth Gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either Now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old dirtier energy sources Rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels We do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going Thats why Im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet And that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system Now none of this is going to happen overnight And yes there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo But the jobs well create the money well save the planet well preserve that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve And its within our graspClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world And thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere theres a problemI told you earlier all the talk of Americas economic decline is political hot air Well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker Let me tell you something The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth Period Period Its not even close Its not even close Its not even close We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office and when it comes to every important international issue people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead they call us I mean its useful to level the set here because when we dont we dont make good decisionsNow as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing I know this is a dangerous time But thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished American strength In todays world were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing statesThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation rooted in conflicts that date back millennia Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition Even as their economy severely contracts Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new realityIts up to us the United States of America to help remake that system And to do that well it means that weve got to set prioritiesPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life including their own can do a lot of damage They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies We have to take them outpBut as we focus on destroying ISIL overthetop claims that this is World War III just play into their hands Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages they pose an enormous danger to civilians they have to be stopped But they do not threaten our national existence That is the story ISIL wants to tell Thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit We dont need to build them up to show that were serious and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions We just need to call them what they are killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed And thats exactly what were doing For more than a year America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISILs financing disrupt their plots stop the flow of terrorist fighters and stamp out their vicious ideology With nearly 10000 air strikes were taking out their leadership their oil their training camps their weapons Were training arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and SyriaIf this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world authorize the use of military force against ISIL Take a vote Take a vote But the American people should know that with or without congressional action ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them If you doubt Americas commitment or mine to see that justice is done just ask Osama bin Laden Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen who was taken out last year or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks who sits in a prison cell When you come after Americans we go after you And it may take time but we have long memories and our reach has no limits Our foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda but it cant stop there For even without ISIL even without al Qaeda instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world in the Middle East in Afghanistan parts of Pakistan in parts of Central America in Africa and Asia Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feeding the next wave of refugees The world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpetbomb civilians That may work as a TV sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stageWe also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis even if its done with the best of intentions Thats not leadership thats a recipe for quagmire spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us Its the lesson of Vietnam its the lesson of Iraq and we should have learned it by now Fortunately there is a smarter approach a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power It says America will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weightThats our approach to conflicts like Syria where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peaceThats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed Iran And as we speak Iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another war Thats how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa Our military our doctors our development workers they were heroic they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic Hundreds of thousands maybe a couple million lives were savedThats how we forged a TransPacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia It cuts 18000 taxes on products made in America which will then support more good jobs here in America With TPP China does not set the rules in that region we do You want to show our strength in this new century Approve this agreement Give us the tools to enforce it Its the right thing to do Let me give you another example Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy and set us back in Latin America Thats why we restored diplomatic relations applause opened the door to travel and commerce positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the Cold War is over lift the embargo The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world except when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charityWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that helps vulnerable countries but it also protects our kids When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decadeslong war that strengthens the international order we depend on When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick applause its the right thing to do and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores Right now were on track to end the scourge of HIVAIDS Thats within our grasp And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something Ill be pushing this Congress to fund this year Thats American strength Thats American leadership And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example Thats why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo It is expensive it is unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies Theres a better way And thats why we need to reject any politics any politics that targets people because of race or religion Let me just say this This is not a matter of political correctness This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faithHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that Im standing on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place When politicians insult Muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizens when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names that doesnt make us safer Thats not telling it like it is Its just wrong It diminishes us in the eyes of the world It makes it harder to achieve our goals It betrays who we are as a country We the People Our Constitution begins with those three simple words words weve come to recognize mean all the people not just some words that insist we rise and fall together and thats how we might perfect our Union And that brings me to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonightThe future we want all of us want opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kids all that is within our reach But it will only happen if we work together It will only happen if we can have rational constructive debates It will only happen if we fix our politicsA better politics doesnt mean we have to agree on everything This is a big country different regions different attitudes different interests Thats one of our strengths too Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue just as they did fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relations over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of securityBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens It doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice It doesnt work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention And most of all democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnt matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interestToo many Americans feel that way right now Its one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and I guarantee Ill keep trying to be better so long as I hold this officeBut my fellow Americans this cannot be my task or any Presidents alone There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected by the noise coming out of your base I know youve told me Its the worstkept secret in Washington And a lot of you arent enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancorBut that means if we want a better politics and Im addressing the American people now if we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President We have to change the system to reflect our better selves I think weve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around Let a bipartisan group do it We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests cant bankroll our elections And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform cant pass muster in the courts we need to work together to find a real solution because its a problem And most of you dont like raising money I know Ive done it Weve got to make it easier to vote not harder We need to modernize it for the way we live now This is America We want to make it easier for people to participate And over the course of this year I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just thatBut I cant do these things on my own Changes in our political process in not just who gets elected but how they get elected that will only happen when the American people demand it It depends on you Thats whats meant by a government of by and for the peopleWhat Im suggesting is hard Its a lot easier to be cynical to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is all the folks who are elected dont care and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter But if we give up now then we forsake a better future Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought even died to secure And then as frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same backgroundWe cant afford to go down that path It wont deliver the economy we want It will not produce the security we want But most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the worldSo my fellow Americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen To vote To speak out To stand up for others especially the weak especially the vulnerable knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single dayIt is not easy Our brand of democracy is hard But I can promise that a little over a year from now when I no longer hold this office I will be right there with you as a citizen inspired by those voices of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native born not as Democrat or Republican but as Americans first bound by a common creed Voices Dr King believed would have the final word voices of unarmed truth and unconditional loveAnd theyre out there those voices They dont get a lot of attention they dont seek a lot of fanfare but theyre busy doing the work this country needs doing I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours I see you the American people And in your daily acts of citizenship I see our future unfoldingI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him offI see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a diseaseI see it in the American who served his time and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat treating everybody with respect doing the brave quiet work of keeping us safe I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon the community that lines up to cheer him onIts the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything hes been taught I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worthThats the America I know Thats the country we love Cleareyed Bighearted Undaunted by challenge Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word Thats what makes me so hopeful about our future I believe in change because I believe in you the American peopleAnd thats why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong Thank you God bless you God bless the United States of America
Well you know I love you back It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes And John Lewis is one of my heroesNow I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel heroics were not on his mind A day like this was not on his mind Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of nonviolence the right way to protect yourself when attacked A doctor described what tear gas does to the body while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones The air was thick with doubt anticipation and fear And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sungNo matter what may be the test God will take care of youLean weary one upon His breast God will take care of youAnd then his knapsack stocked with an apple a toothbrush and a book on government all you need for a night behind bars John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change AmericaPresident and Mrs Bush Governor Bentley Mayor Evans Sewell Reverend Strong members of Congress elected officials foot soldiers friends fellow AmericansAs John noted there are places and moments in America where this nations destiny has been decided Many are sites of war Concord and Lexington Appomattox Gettysburg Others are sites that symbolize the daring of Americas character Independence Hall and Seneca Falls Kitty Hawk and Cape CanaveralSelma is such a place In one afternoon 50 years ago so much of our turbulent history the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow the death of four little girls in Birmingham and the dream of a Baptist preacher all that history met on this bridge It was not a clash of armies but a clash of wills a contest to determine the true meaning of America And because of men and women like John Lewis Joseph Lowery Hosea Williams Amelia Boynton Diane Nash Ralph Abernathy CT Vivian Andrew Young Fred Shuttlesworth Dr Martin Luther King Jr and so many others the idea of a just America and a fair America an inclusive America and a generous America that idea ultimately triumphedAs is true across the landscape of American history we cannot examine this moment in isolation The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations the leaders that day part of a long line of heroesWe gather here to celebrate them We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod tear gas and the trampling hoof men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justiceThey did as Scripture instructed Rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer And in the days to come they went back again and again When the trumpet call sounded for more to join the people came black and white young and old Christian and Jew waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope A white newsman Bill Plante who covered the marches then and who is with us here today quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing To those who marched though those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweetIn time their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson And he would send them protection and speak to the nation echoing their call for America and the world to hear We shall overcome What enormous faith these men and women had Faith in God but also faith in America The Americans who crossed this bridge they were not physically imposing But they gave courage to millions They held no elected office But they led a nation They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence countless daily indignities but they didnt seek special treatment just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before What they did here will reverberate through the ages Not because the change they won was preordained not because their victory was complete but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible that love and hope can conquer hateAs we commemorate their achievement we are wellserved to remember that at the time of the marches many in power condemned rather than praised them Back then they were called Communists or halfbreeds or outside agitators sexual and moral degenerates and worse they were called everything but the name their parents gave them Their faith was questioned Their lives were threatened Their patriotism challengedAnd yet what could be more American than what happened in this place What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people unsung the downtrodden the dreamers not of high station not born to wealth or privilege not of one religious tradition but many coming together to shape their countrys course What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished that we are strong enough to be selfcritical that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals Thats why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience Thats why its not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents We the Peoplein order to form a more perfect union We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal These are not just words Theyre a living thing a call to action a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny For founders like Franklin and Jefferson for leaders like Lincoln and FDR the success of our experiment in selfgovernment rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work And thats what we celebrate here in Selma Thats what this movement was all about one leg in our long journey toward freedom The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge thats the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny Its the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot workers to organize against an unjust status quo the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon Its the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths It requires the occasional disruption the willingness to speak out for what is right to shake up the status quo Thats America Thats what makes us unique Thats what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule They saw what John Lewis had done From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine this generation of young people can draw strength from this place where the powerless could change the worlds greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom They saw that idea made real right here in Selma Alabama They saw that idea manifest itself here in AmericaBecause of campaigns like this a Voting Rights Act was passed Political and economic and social barriers came down And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms who sit on the bench who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office Because of what they did the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks but for every American Women marched through those doors Latinos marched through those doors Asian Americans gay Americans Americans with disabilities they all came through those doors Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again not by reasserting the past but by transcending the past What a glorious thing Dr King might say And what a solemn debt we owe Which leads us to ask just how might we repay that debtFirst and foremost we have to recognize that one days commemoration no matter how special is not enough If Selma taught us anything its that our work is never done The American experiment in selfgovernment gives work and purpose to each generationSelma teaches us as well that action requires that we shed our cynicism For when it comes to the pursuit of justice we can afford neither complacency nor despairJust this week I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justices Ferguson report shows that with respect to race little has changed in this country And I understood the question the reports narrative was sadly familiar It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement But I rejected the notion that nothings changed What happened in Ferguson may not be unique but its no longer endemic Its no longer sanctioned by law or by custom And before the Civil Rights Movement it most surely was We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable that racial division is inherent to America If you think nothings changed in the past 50 years ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothings changed Ask your gay friend if its easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago To deny this progress this hardwon progress our progress would be to rob us of our own agency our own capacity our responsibility to do what we can to make America better Of course a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident that racism is banished that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes We dont need the Ferguson report to know thats not true We just need to open our eyes and our ears and our hearts to know that this nations racial history still casts its long shadow upon us We know the march is not yet over We know the race is not yet won We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged all of us by the content of our character requires admitting as much facing up to the truth We are capable of bearing a great burden James Baldwin once wrote once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is Theres nothing America cant handle if we actually look squarely at the problem And this is work for all Americans not just some Not just whites Not just blacks If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions on our attitudes the things we teach our children And if we make such an effort no matter how hard it may sometimes seem laws can be passed and consciences can be stirred and consensus can be built With such an effort we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some Together we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago the protection of the law Together we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads and good workers and good neighbors With effort we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity Americans dont accept a free ride for anybody nor do we believe in equality of outcomes But we do expect equal opportunity And if we really mean it if were not just giving lip service to it but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it then yes we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job and a fair wage and a real voice and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle classAnd with effort we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge and that is the right to vote Right now in 2015 50 years after Selma there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote As we speak more of such laws are being proposed Meanwhile the Voting Rights Act the culmination of so much blood so much sweat and tears the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence the Voting Rights Act stands weakened its future subject to political rancorHow can that be The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy the result of Republican and Democratic efforts President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office President George W Bush signed its renewal when he was in office One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it If we want to honor this day let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more and together pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year Thats how we honor those on this bridge Of course our democracy is not the task of Congress alone or the courts alone or even the President alone If every new votersuppression law was struck down today we would still have here in America one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples Fifty years ago registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar the number of bubbles on a bar of soap It meant risking your dignity and sometimes your life Whats our excuse today for not voting How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought How do we so fully give away our power our voice in shaping Americas future Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places We give away our power Fellow marchers so much has changed in 50 years We have endured war and weve fashioned peace Weve seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship that willingness of a 26yearold deacon or a Unitarian minister or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that theyd risk everything to realize its promiseThats what it means to love America Thats what it means to believe in America Thats what it means when we say America is exceptional For we were born of change We broke the old aristocracies declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of selfgovernment of and by and for the people Thats why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction because we know our efforts matter We know America is what we make of itLook at our history We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea pioneers who braved the unfamiliar followed by a stampede of farmers and miners and entrepreneurs and hucksters Thats our spirit Thats who we areWe are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer women who could do as much as any man and then some And were Susan B Anthony who shook the system until the law reflected that truth That is our characterWere the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores the huddled masses yearning to breathe free Holocaust survivors Soviet defectors the Lost Boys of Sudan Were the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life Thats how we came to be Were the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South Were the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West and countless laborers who laid rail and raised skyscrapers and organized for workers rightsWere the freshfaced GIs who fought to liberate a continent And were the Tuskeegee Airmen and the Navajo codetalkers and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied Were the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 911 the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq Were the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York just as blood ran down this bridge We are storytellers writers poets artists who abhor unfairness and despise hypocrisy and give voice to the voiceless and tell truths that need to be toldWere the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues bluegrass and country and hiphop and rock and roll and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedomWe are Jackie Robinson enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head and stealing home in the World Series anyway We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who build our temples for tomorrow strong as we know how We are the people Emerson wrote of who for truth and honors sake stand fast and suffer long who are never tired so long as we can see far enoughThats what America is Not stock photos or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others We respect the past but we dont pine for the past We dont fear the future we grab for it America is not some fragile thing We are large in the words of Whitman containing multitudes We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy perpetually young in spirit Thats why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march And thats what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day You are America Unconstrained by habit and convention Unencumbered by what is because youre ready to seize what ought to be For everywhere in this country there are first steps to be taken theres new ground to cover there are more bridges to be crossed And it is you the young and fearless at heart the most diverse and educated generation in our history who the nation is waiting to followBecause Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person Because the singlemost powerful word in our democracy is the word We We The People We Shall Overcome Yes We Can That word is owned by no one It belongs to everyone Oh what a glorious task we are given to continually try to improve this great nation of oursFifty years from Bloody Sunday our march is not yet finished but were getting closer Two hundred and thirtynine years after this nations founding our union is not yet perfect but we are getting closer Our jobs easier because somebody already got us through that first mile Somebody already got us over that bridge When it feels the road is too hard when the torch weve been passed feels too heavy we will remember these early travelers and draw strength from their example and hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength They will soar on the wings like eagles They will run and not grow weary They will walk and not be faint We honor those who walked so we could run We must run so our children soar And we will not grow weary For we believe in the power of an awesome God and we believe in this countrys sacred promiseMay He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us and bless the United States of America Thank you everybody
Mr Speaker Mr Vice President Members of Congress my fellow Americans We are 15 years into this new century Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world It has been and still is a hard time for many But tonight we turn the page Tonight after a breakthrough year for America our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis More of our kids are graduating than ever before More of our people are insured than ever before And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weve been in almost 30 years Tonight for the first time since 911 our combat mission in Afghanistan is over Six years ago nearly 180000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan Today fewer than 15000 remain And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 911 Generation who has served to keep us safe We are humbled and grateful for your service America for all that we have endured for all the grit and hard work required to come back for all the tasks that lie ahead know this The shadow of crisis has passed and the State of the Union is strong At this moment with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort Will we approach the world fearful and reactive dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing Or will we lead wisely using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward In two weeks I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical not partisan And in the months ahead Ill crisscross the country making a case for those ideas So tonight I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us It begins with our economy Seven years ago Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds She waited tables He worked construction Their first child Jack was on the way They were young and in love in America And it doesnt get much better than that If only we had known Rebekah wrote to me last spring what was about to happen to the housing and construction market As the crisis worsened Bens business dried up so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career They sacrificed for each other And slowly it paid off They bought their first home They had a second son Henry Rebekah got a better job and then a raise Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night It is amazing Rebekah wrote what you can bounce back from when you have towe are a strong tightknit family who has made it through some very very hard times We are a strong tightknit family who has made it through some very very hard times America Rebekah and Bens story is our story They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled You are the reason that I ran for this office You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation And it has been your resilience your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores And over the past five years our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet And today America is number one in oil and gas America is number one in wind power Every three weeks we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008 And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards the typical family this year should save about 750 at the pump We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world And today our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high More Americans finish college than ever before We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis shield families from ruin and encourage fair competition Today we have new tools to stop taxpayerfunded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices And in the past year alone about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage At every step we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious that we would crush jobs and explode deficits Instead weve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade our deficits cut by twothirds a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years This is good news people and applause So the verdict is clear Middleclass economics works Expanding opportunity works And these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the way We cant slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns We cant put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when weve got to fix a broken system And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things I will veto it It will have earned my veto Today thanks to a growing economy the recovery is touching more and more lives Wages are finally starting to rise again We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007 But heres the thing Those of us here tonight we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnt screw things up that government doesnt halt the progress were making We need to do more than just do no harm Tonight together lets do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American Because families like Rebekahs still need our help She and Ben are working as hard as ever but theyve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement Friday night pizza thats a big splurge Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota Like millions of hardworking Americans Rebekah isnt asking for a handout but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead And in fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot We set up worker protections Social Security Medicare Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity We gave our citizens schools and colleges infrastructure and the Internet tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them Thats what middleclass economics is the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot everyone does their fair share everyone plays by the same set of rules We dont just want everyone to share in Americas success we want everyone to contribute to our success So what does middleclass economics require in our time First middleclass economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change That means helping folks afford childcare college health care a home retirement And my budget will address each of these issues lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year Heres one example During World War II when men like my grandfather went off to war having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority so this country provided universal childcare In todays economy when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families we need affordable highquality childcare more than ever Its not a nicetohave its a musthave So its time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or as a womens issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us And thats why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middleclass and lowincome family with young children in America by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to 3000 per child per year Heres another example Today we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesnt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers Fortythree million workers have no paid sick leave 43 million Think about that And that forces too many parents to make the gutwrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home So Ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November lets put it to a vote right here in Washington Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave Its the right thing to do Its the right thing to do Of course nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages Thats why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work Its 2015 Its time We still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyve earned And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage I say this If you truly believe you could work fulltime and support a family on less than 15000 a year try it If not vote to give millions of the hardestworking people in America a raise Now these ideas wont make everybody rich wont relieve every hardship Thats not the job of government To give working families a fair shot we still need more employers to see beyond next quarters earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their companys longterm interest We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions and give American workers a voice But you know things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families Thats a fact And thats what all of us Republicans and Democrats alike were sent here to doSecond to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free sent a generation of GIs to college trained the best workforce in the world We were ahead of the curve But other countries caught on And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before we need to up our game We need to do more By the end of this decade two in three job openings will require some higher education two in three And yet we still live in a country where too many bright striving Americans are priced out of the education they need Its not fair to them and its sure not smart for our future Thats why Im sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college Some are young and starting out Some are older and looking for a better job Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market Whoever you are this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt Understand youve got to earn it Youve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time Tennessee a state with Republican leadership and Chicago a city with Democratic leadership are showing that free community college is possible I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today Lets stay ahead of the curve And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnt derail anyones dreams Thanks to Vice President Bidens great work to update our job training system were connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill highpaying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics Tonight Im also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer moreeducational benefits and paid apprenticeships opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higherpaying jobs even if they dont have a higher education And as a new generation of veterans comes home we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend Already weve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care Were slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need And were making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs And Joining Forces the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden applause thank you Michelle thank you Jill has helped nearly 700000 veterans and military spouses get a new job So to every CEO in America let me repeat If you want somebody whos going to get the job done and done right hire a veteran Finally as we better train our workers we need the new economy to keep churning out highwage jobs for our workers to fill Since 2010 America has put more people back to work than Europe Japan and all advanced economies combined Our manufacturers have added almost 800000 new jobs Some of our bedrock sectors like our auto industry are booming But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didnt even exist 10 or 20 years ago jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future But we do know we want them here in America We know that And thats why the third part of middleclass economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere the place where businesses want to locate and hire Twentyfirst century businesses need 21st century infrastructure modern ports and stronger bridges faster trains and the fastest Internet Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this So lets set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline Lets pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come Lets do it Lets get it done Lets get it done Twentyfirst century businesses including small businesses need to sell more American products overseas Today our businesses export more than ever and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages But as we speak China wants to write the rules for the worlds fastestgrowing region That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage Why would we let that happen We should write those rules We should level the playing field Thats why Im asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that arent just free but are also fair Its the right thing to do Look Im the first one to admit that past trade deals havent always lived up to the hype and thats why weve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense But 95 percent of the worlds customers live outside our borders We cant close ourselves off from those opportunities More than half of manufacturing executives have said theyre actively looking to bring jobs back from China So lets give them one more reason to get it done Twentyfirst century businesses will rely on American science and technology research and development I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine one that delivers the right treatment at the right time In some patients with cystic fibrosis this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable So tonight Im launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier We can do this I intend to protect a free and open Internet extend its reach to every classroom and every community applause and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs converting sunlight into liquid fuel creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit but to stay Last month we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars And in two months to prepare us for those missions Scott Kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space So good luck Captain Make sure to Instagram it Were proud of you Now the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research I know theres bipartisan support in this chamber Members of both parties have told me so Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments As Americans we dont mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too But for far too long lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight Theyve riddled it with giveaways that the superrich dont need while denying a break to middleclass families who do This year we have an opportunity to change that Lets close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America Lets use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home Lets simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford And lets close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy and we can achieve that together We can achieve it together Helping hardworking families make ends meet Giving them the tools they need for goodpaying jobs in this new economy Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness This is where America needs to go I believe its where the American people want to go It will make our economy stronger a year from now 15 years from now and deep into the century ahead Of course if theres one thing this new century has taught us its that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores My first duty as CommanderinChief is to defend the United States of America In doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world but how When we make rash decisions reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer more prosperous world Thats what our enemies want us to do I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we dont let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents Thats exactly what were doing right now And around the globe it is making a difference First we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies At the same time weve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan weve trained their security forces who have now taken the lead and weve honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that countrys first democratic transition Instead of sending large ground forces overseas were partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America In Iraq and Syria American leadership including our military power is stopping ISILs advance Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East we are leading a broad coalition including Arab nations to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group Were also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism Now this effort will take time It will require focus But we will succeed And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL We need that authority Second were demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy Were upholding the principle that bigger nations cant bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraines democracy and reassuring our NATO allies Last year as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states Mr Putins aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength Thats what I heard from some folks Well today it is America that stands strong and united with our allies while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters Thats how America leads not with bluster but with persistent steady resolve In Cuba we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date When what youre doing doesnt work for 50 years its time to try something new And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba It stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people And this year Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo As His Holiness Pope Francis has said diplomacy is the work of small steps These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba And after years in prison we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs Welcome home Alan Were glad youre here Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran where for the first time in a decade weve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material Between now and this spring we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nucleararmed Iran secures America and our allies including Israel while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating America from its allies making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again It doesnt make sense And thats why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort and I intend to stay true to that wisdom Third were looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century No foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families especially our kids So were making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats just as we have done to combat terrorism And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks combat identity theft and protect our childrens information That should be a bipartisan effort If we dont act well leave our nation and our economy vulnerable If we do we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe In West Africa our troops our scientists our doctors our nurses our health care workers are rolling back Ebola saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease I could not be prouder of them and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts But the job is not yet done and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty In the Asia Pacific we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade how they resolve maritime disputes how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief And no challenge no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change 2014 was the planets warmest year on record Now one year doesnt make a trend but this does 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century Ive heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyre not scientists that we dont have enough information to act Well Im not a scientist either But you know what I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate and if we dont act forcefully well continue to see rising oceans longer hotter heat waves dangerous droughts and floods and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security We should act like it And thats why over the past six years weve done more than ever to combat climate change from the way we produce energy to the way we use it Thats why weve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history And thats why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action In Beijing we made a historic announcement The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution And China committed for the first time to limiting their emissions And because the worlds two largest economies came together other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weve got And theres one last pillar of our leadership and thats the example of our values As Americans we respect human dignity even when were threatened which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained Its why we speak out against the deplorable antiSemitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world Its why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace Thats why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do but because ultimately they will make us safer As Americans we have a profound commitment to justice So it makes no sense to spend 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit Since Ive been President weve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half Now it is time to finish the job And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down It is not who we are Its time to close Gitmo As Americans we cherish our civil liberties and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs I have not As promised our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse And next month well issue a report on how were keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy Looking to the future instead of the past Making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities Leading always with the example of our values Thats what makes us exceptional Thats what keeps us strong Thats why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards our own You know just over a decade ago I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasnt a liberal America or a conservative America a black America or a white America but a United States of America I said this because I had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance because I grew up in Hawaii a melting pot of races and customs because I made Illinois my home a state of small towns rich farmland one of the worlds great cities a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents good people of every ethnicity and every faith share certain bedrock values Over the past six years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasnt delivered on this vision How ironic they say that our politics seems more divided than ever Its held up as proof not just of my own flaws of which there are many but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided nave that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it I know how tempting such cynicism may be But I still think the cynics are wrong I still believe that we are one people I still believe that together we can do great things even when the odds are long I believe this because over and over in my six years in office I have seen America at its best Ive seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point Annapolis Colorado Springs New London Ive mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown in Boston in West Texas and West Virginia Ive watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains from Midwest assembly lines to the MidAtlantic seaboard Ive seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home So I know the good and optimistic and bighearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brothers keeper and our sisters keeper And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example So the question for those of us here tonight is how we all of us can better reflect Americas hopes Ive served in Congress with many of you I know many of you well There are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle And many of you have told me that this isnt what you signed up for arguing past each other on cable shows the constant fundraising always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns Imagine if we did something different Understand a better politics isnt one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine A better politics is one where we appeal to each others basic decency instead of our basest fears A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with peoples daily lives A politics a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility asking them to join in the great mission of building America If were going to have arguments lets have arguments but lets make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country We still may not agree on a womans right to choose but surely we can agree its a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing alltime lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs Yes passions still fly on immigration but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child and that its possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants Ive talked to Republicans and Democrats about that Thats something that we can share We may go at it in campaign season but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred that its being denied to too many applause and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act we can come together Democrats and Republicans to make voting easier for every single American We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York But surely we can understand a father who fears his son cant walk home without being harassed And surely we can understand the wife who wont rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift Andsurely we can agree that its a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans community leaders and law enforcement to reform Americas criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us Thats a better politics Thats how we start rebuilding trust Thats how we move this country forward Thats what the American people want And thats what they deserve I have no more campaigns to run My only agenda laughter I know because I won both of them My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one Ive had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol to do what I believe is best for America If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight I ask you to join me in the work at hand If you disagree with parts of it I hope youll at least work with me where you do agree And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger Because I want this chamber I want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides to unite in common effort to help our neighbors whether down the street or on the other side of the world I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood your life matters and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift that were a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman young and old black and white Latino Asian immigrant Native American gay straight Americans with mental illness or physical disability Everybody matters I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states that we are the United States of America I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years Its amazing what you can bounce back from when you have towe are a strong tightknit family whos made it through some very very hard times My fellow Americans we too are a strong tightknit family We too have made it through some hard times Fifteen years into this new century we have picked ourselves up dusted ourselves off and begun again the work of remaking America We have laid a new foundation A brighter future is ours to write Lets begin this new chapter together and lets start the work right now Thank you God bless you God bless this country we love Thank you
My fellow Americans tonight Id like to talk with you about immigrationFor more than 200 years our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations Its kept us youthful dynamic and entrepreneurial It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities people not trapped by our past but able to remake ourselves as we chooseBut today our immigration system is broken and everybody knows itFamilies who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows or risk their families being torn apartIts been this way for decades And for decades we havent done much about itWhen I took office I committed to fixing this broken immigration system And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders Today we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history And over the past six years illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half Although this summer there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border the number of such children is now actually lower than its been in nearly two years Overall the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s Those are the factsMeanwhile I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix and last year 68 Democrats Republicans and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate It wasnt perfect It was a compromise But it reflected common sense It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine started paying their taxes and went to the back of the line And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficitsHad the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yesorno vote it would have passed with support from both parties and today it would be the law But for a year and a half now Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple voteNow I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law But until that happens there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more justTonight I am announcing those actionsFirst well build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings and speed the return of those who do cross overSecond Ill make it easier and faster for highskilled immigrants graduates and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy as so many business leaders have proposedThird well take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our countryI want to say more about this third issue because it generates the most passion and controversy Even as we are a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws and I believe that they must be held accountable especially those who may be dangerous Thats why over the past six years deportations of criminals are up 80 percent And thats why were going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security Felons not families Criminals not children Gang members not a mom whos working hard to provide for her kids Well prioritize just like law enforcement does every dayBut even as we focus on deporting criminals the fact is millions of immigrants in every state of every race and nationality still live here illegally And lets be honest tracking down rounding up and deporting millions of people isnt realistic Anyone who suggests otherwise isnt being straight with you Its also not who we are as Americans After all most of these immigrants have been here a long time They work hard often in tough lowpaying jobs They support their families They worship at our churches Many of their kids are Americanborn or spent most of their lives here and their hopes dreams and patriotism are just like ours As my predecessor President Bush once put it They are a part of American lifeNow heres the thing We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded So were going to offer the following deal If youve been in America for more than five years if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents if you register pass a criminal background check and youre willing to pay your fair share of taxes youll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law Thats what this deal isNow lets be clear about what it isnt This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future It does not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently or offer the same benefits that citizens receive only Congress can do that All were saying is were not going to deport youI know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty Well its not Amnesty is the immigration system we have today millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election timeThats the real amnesty leaving this broken system the way it is Mass amnesty would be unfair Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character What Im describing is accountability a commonsense middleground approach If you meet the criteria you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law If youre a criminal youll be deported If you plan to enter the US illegally your chances of getting caught and sent back just went upThe actions Im taking are not only lawful theyre the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed I have one answer Pass a billI want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution And the day I sign that bill into law the actions I take will no longer be necessary Meanwhile dont let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue Thats not how our democracy works and Congress certainly shouldnt shut down our government again just because we disagree on this Americans are tired of gridlock What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose a higher purposeMost Americans support the types of reforms Ive talked about tonight But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home Millions of us myself included go back generations in this country with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens So we dont like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenshipI know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are or take our jobs or stick it to middleclass families at a time when they already feel like theyve gotten the raw deal for over a decade I hear these concerns But thats not what these steps would do Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society And I believe its important that all of us have this debate without impugning each others characterBecause for all the back and forth of Washington we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger Its about who we are as a country and who we want to be for future generationsAre we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends take responsibility and give their kids a better futureAre we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents arms Or are we a nation that values families and works together to keep them togetherAre we a nation that educates the worlds best and brightest in our universities only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here create businesses here create industries right here in AmericaThats what this debate is all about We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration We need reasoned thoughtful compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes not our fears I know the politics of this issue are tough But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about itOver the past few years I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government and at risk any moment of losing it all just to build a better life for their kids Ive seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didnt have the right papers Ive seen the courage of students who except for the circumstances of their birth are as American as Malia or Sasha students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they loveThese people our neighbors our classmates our friends they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life They came to work and study and serve in our military and above all contribute to Americas successTomorrow Ill travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students including a young woman named Astrid Silva Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old Her only possessions were a cross her doll and the frilly dress she had on When she started school she didnt speak any English She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS and she became a good student Her father worked in landscaping Her mom cleaned other peoples homes They wouldnt let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school not because they didnt love her but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant so she applied behind their back and got in Still she mostly lived in the shadows until her grandmother who visited every year from Mexico passed away and she couldnt travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her and today Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degreeAre we a nation that kicks out a striving hopeful immigrant like Astrid or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger for we know the heart of a stranger we were strangers once tooMy fellow Americans we are and always will be a nation of immigrants We were strangers once too And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic or the Pacific or the Rio Grande we are here only because this country welcomed them in and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like or what our last names are or how we worship What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we willThats the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us Thats the tradition we must uphold Thats the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to comeThank you God bless you And God bless this country we love
Mr Speaker Mr Vice President Members of Congress my fellow AmericansToday in America a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it and did her part to lift Americas graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decadesAn entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years An autoworker finetuned some of the best most fuelefficient cars in the world and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oilA farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest fiveyear stretch of farm exports in our history A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift bonetired but dreaming big dreams for his son And in tightknit communities across America fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids put an arm around their spouse remember fallen comrades and give thanks for being home from a war that after twelve long years is finally coming to an endTonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you our citizens who make the state of our union strong Here are the results of your efforts The lowest unemployment rate in over five years A rebounding housing market A manufacturing sector thats adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time thats happened in nearly twenty years Our deficits cut by more than half And for the first time in over a decade business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the worlds number one place to invest America isThats why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America After five years of grit and determined effort the United States is betterpositioned for the 21st century than any other nation on EarthThe question for everyone in this chamber running through every decision we make this year is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress For several years now this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government Its an important debate one that dates back to our very founding But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States then we are not doing right by the American peopleAs President Im committed to making Washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here I believe most of you are too Last month thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last years severe cuts to priorities like education Nobody got everything they wanted and we can still do more to invest in this countrys future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs not creating new crisesIn the coming months lets see where else we can make progress together Lets make this a year of action Thats what most Americans want for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives their hopes their aspirations And what I believe unites the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor is the simple profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get aheadLets face it that belief has suffered some serious blows Over more than three decades even before the Great Recession hit massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good middleclass jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend onToday after four years of economic growth corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher and those at the top have never done better But average wages have barely budged Inequality has deepened Upward mobility has stalled The cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by let alone get ahead And too many still arent working at allOur job is to reverse these trends It wont happen right away and we wont agree on everything But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete practical proposals to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class Some require Congressional action and Im eager to work with all of you But America does not stand still and neither will I So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families thats what Im going to do As usual our First Lady sets a good example Michelles Lets Move partnership with schools businesses and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400000 veterans and military spouses Taking a page from that playbook the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already 150 universities businesses and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus Across the country were partnering with mayors governors and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equalityThe point is there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward They believe and I believe that here in America our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams Thats what drew our forebears here Its how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of Americas largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth Opportunity is who we are And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promiseWe know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job With the economy picking up speed companies say they intend to hire more people this year And over half of big manufacturers say theyre thinking of insourcing jobs from abroadSo lets make that decision easier for more companies Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad Lets flip that equation Lets work together to close those loopholes end those incentives to ship jobs overseas and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at homeMoreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads upgrading our ports unclogging our commutes because in todays global economy firstclass jobs gravitate to firstclass infrastructure Well need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possibleWe also have the chance right now to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of hightech manufacturing jobs My administration has launched two hubs for hightech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown where weve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies Tonight Im announcing well launch six more this year Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to workLets do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America Over the past five years my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other And when ninetyeight percent of our exporters are small businesses new trade partnerships with Europe and the AsiaPacific will help them create more jobs We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped Made in the USA China and Europe arent standing on the sidelines Neither should weWe know that the nation that goes allin on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow This is an edge America cannot surrender Federallyfunded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones Thats why Congress should undo the damage done by last years cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery whether its vaccines that stay ahead of drugresistant bacteria or paperthin material thats stronger than steel And lets pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation not costly needless litigationNow one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy The alloftheabove energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working and today America is closer to energy independence than weve been in decadesOne of the reasons why is natural gas if extracted safely its the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change Businesses plan to invest almost 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas Ill cut red tape to help states get those factories built and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air our water and our communities And while were at it Ill use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generationsIts not just oil and natural gas production thats booming were becoming a global leader in solar too Every four minutes another American home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cant be outsourced Lets continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that dont need it so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that doAnd even as weve increased energy production weve partnered with businesses builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume When we rescued our automakers for example we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars In the coming months Ill build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pumpTaken together our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet Over the past eight years the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods Thats why I directed my administration to work with states utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air The shift to a cleaner energy economy wont happen overnight and it will require tough choices along the way But the debate is settled Climate change is a fact And when our childrens children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer more stable world with new sources of energy I want us to be able to sayyes we didFinally if we are serious about economic growth it is time to heed the call of business leaders labor leaders faith leaders and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades And for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams to study invent and contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone So lets get immigration reform done this yearThe ideas Ive outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs But in this rapidlychanging economy we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobsThe good news is we know how to do it Two years ago as the auto industry came roaring back Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit She knew that Ford needed parts for the bestselling truck in America and she knew how to make them She just needed the workforce So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or better job She was flooded with new workers And today Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employeesWhat Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker So tonight Ive asked Vice President Biden to lead an acrosstheboard reform of Americas training programs to make sure they have one mission train Americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now That means more onthejob training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs And if Congress wants to help you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more readytowork Americans with readytobefilled jobsIm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that its more effective in todays economy But first this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 16 million peopleLet me tell you whyMisty DeMars is a mother of two young boys Shed been steadily employed since she was a teenager She put herself through college Shed never collected unemployment benefits In May she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home A week later budget cuts claimed the job she loved Last month when their unemployment insurance was cut off she sat down and wrote me a letter the kind I get every day We are the face of the unemployment crisis she wrote I am not dependent on the governmentOur country depends on people like us who build careers contribute to societycare about our neighborsI am confident that in time I will find a jobI will pay my taxes and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love Please give us this chanceCongress give these hardworking responsible Americans that chance They need our help but more important this country needs them in the game Thats why Ive been asking CEOs to give more longterm unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week many will come to the White House to make that commitment real Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team Of course its not enough to train todays workforce We also have to prepare tomorrows workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a worldclass educationEstiven Rodriguez couldnt speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine But last month thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office where they mailed off their college applications And this son of a factory worker just found out hes going to college this fallFive years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids We worked with lenders to reform student loans and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before Race to the Top with the help of governors from both parties has helped states raise expectations and performance Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington DC are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy problem solving critical thinking science technology engineering and math Some of this change is hard It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test But its worth it and its working The problem is were still not reaching enough kids and were not reaching them in time That has to change Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a childs life is highquality early education Last year I asked this Congress to help states make highquality preK available to every four yearold As a parent as well as a President I repeat that request tonight But in the meantime thirty states have raised prek funding on their own They know we cant wait So just as we worked with states to reform our schools this year well invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children And as Congress decides what its going to do Im going to pull together a coalition of elected officials business leaders and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the highquality preK they needLast year I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to highspeed broadband over the next four years Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple Microsoft Sprint and Verizon weve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years without adding a dime to the deficit Were working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the realworld education and handson training that can lead directly to a job and career Were shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value so that no middleclass kid is priced out of a college education Were offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt And Im reaching out to some of Americas leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potentialThe bottom line is Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us But we know our opportunity agenda wont be complete and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single American Today women make up about half our workforce But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns That is wrong and in 2014 its an embarrassment A woman deserves equal pay for equal work She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship and you know what a father does too Its time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode This year lets all come together Congress the White House and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street to give every woman the opportunity she deserves Because I firmly believe when women succeed America succeedsNow women hold a majority of lowerwage jobs but theyre not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages Americans understand that some people will earn more than others and we dont resent those who by virtue of their efforts achieve incredible success But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in povertyIn the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage five states have passed laws to raise theirs Many businesses have done it on their own Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss John Soranno Johns an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis and Nick helps make the dough Only now he makes more of it John just gave his employees a raise to ten bucks an hour a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their moraleTonight I ask more of Americas business leaders to follow Johns lead and do what you can to raise your employees wages To every mayor governor and state legislator in America I say you dont have to wait for Congress to act Americans will support you if you take this on And as a chief executive I intend to lead by example Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover We should too In the coming weeks I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federallyfunded employees a fair wage of at least 1010 an hour because if you cook our troops meals or wash their dishes you shouldnt have to live in povertyOf course to reach millions more Congress needs to get on board Today the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 1010 This will help families It will give businesses customers with more money to spend It doesnt involve any new bureaucratic program So join the rest of the country Say yes Give America a raiseThere are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit Right now it helps about half of all parents at some point But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesnt do enough for single workers who dont have kids So lets work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more Americans get aheadLets do more to help Americans save for retirement Today most workers dont have a pension A Social Security check often isnt enough on its own And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years that doesnt help folks who dont have 401ks Thats why tomorrow I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings MyRA Its a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in And if this Congress wants to help work with me to fix an upsidedown tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save but does little to nothing for middleclass Americans Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can And since the most important investment many families make is their home send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of AmericansOne last point on financial security For decades few things exposed hardworking families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system And in case you havent heard were in the process of fixing thatA preexisting condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona couldnt get health insurance But on January 1st she got covered On January 3rd she felt a sharp pain On January 6th she had emergency surgery Just one week earlier Amanda said that surgery wouldve meant bankruptcyThats what health insurance reform is all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes you dont have to lose everything Already because of the Affordable Care Act more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents plansMore than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverageAnd heres another number zero Because of this law no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma back pain or cancer No woman can ever be charged more just because shes a woman And we did all this while adding years to Medicares finances keeping Medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniorsNow I dont expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law But I know that the American people arent interested in refighting old battles So again if you have specific plans to cut costs cover more people and increase choice tell America what youd do differently Lets see if the numbers add up But lets not have another fortysomething votes to repeal a law thats already helping millions of Americans like Amanda The first forty were plenty We got it We all owe it to the American people to say what were for not just what were against And if you want to know the real impact this law is having just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky whos here tonight Kentuckys not the most liberal part of the country but hes like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealths families They are our friends and neighbors he said They are people we shop and go to church withfarmers out on the tractorsgrocery clerksthey are people who go to work every morning praying they dont get sick No one deserves to live that way Steves right Thats why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st Moms get on your kids to sign up Kids call your mom and walk her through the application It will give her some peace of mind plus shell appreciate hearing from you After all thats the spirit that has always moved this nation forward Its the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as wellCitizenship means standing up for everyones right to vote Last year part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote Lets support these efforts It should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drives our democracyCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day I have seen the courage of parents students pastors and police officers all over this country who say we are not afraid and I intend to keep trying with or without Congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters shopping malls or schools like Sandy HookCitizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of selfgovernment an obligation to serve to our communities And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed ForcesTonight because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free the United States is more secure When I took office nearly 180000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan Today all our troops are out of Iraq More than 60000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security our troops have moved to a support role Together with our allies we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and Americas longest war will finally be overAfter 2014 we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our countryThe fact is that danger remains While we have put al Qaedas core leadership on a path to defeat the threat has evolved as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world In Yemen Somalia Iraq and Mali we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks In Syria well support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks Here at home well keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks And as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missionsWe have to remain vigilant But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone As CommanderinChief I have used force when needed to protect the American people and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office But I will not send our troops into harms way unless its truly necessary nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in openended conflicts We must fight the battles that need to be fought not those that terrorists prefer from us largescale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremismSo even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners America must move off a permanent war footing Thats why Ive imposed prudent limits on the use of drones for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence Thats why working with this Congress I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated And with the Afghan war ending this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the worldYou see in a world of complex threats our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power including strong and principled diplomacy American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles American diplomacy backed by the threat of force is why Syrias chemical weapons are being eliminated and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship terror and fear As we speak American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their sideAnd it is American diplomacy backed by pressure that has halted the progress of Irans nuclear program and rolled parts of that program back for the very first time in a decade As we gather here tonight Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium It is not installing advanced centrifuges Unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a bomb And with our allies and partners were engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weaponThese negotiations will be difficult They may not succeed We are cleareyed about Irans support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away But these negotiations do not rely on trust any longterm deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb If John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries todayThe sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible But let me be clear if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks I will veto it For the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed If Irans leaders do not seize this opportunity then I will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon But if Irans leaders do seize the chance then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of warFinally lets remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge greater cooperation to expand new markets to free people from fear and want And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known From Tunisia to Burma were supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy In Ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their countrys future Across Africa were bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty In the Americas we are building new ties of commerce but were also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people And we will continue to focus on the AsiaPacific where we support our allies shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster as we did in the Philippines when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon and were greeted with words like We will never forget your kindness and God bless AmericaWe do these things because they help promote our longterm security And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation And next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red white and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the goldMy fellow Americans no other country in the world does what we do On every issue the world turns to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance themNo one knows this better than those who serve in uniform As this time of war draws to a close a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life Well keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits theyve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care including the mental health care that they need Well keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military familiesLet me tell you about one of those families Ive come to knowI first met Cory Remsburg a proud Army Ranger at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of DDay Along with some of his fellow Rangers he walked me through the program a strong impressive young man with an easy manner sharp as a tack We joked around and took pictures and I told him to stay in touchA few months later on his tenth deployment Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan His comrades found him in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain For months he lay in a coma The next time I met him in the hospital he couldnt speak he could barely move Over the years hes endured dozens of surgeries and procedures and hours of grueling rehab every day Even now Cory is still blind in one eye He still struggles on his left side But slowly steadily with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig and the community around him Cory has grown stronger Day by day hes learned to speak again and stand again and walk again and hes working toward the day when he can serve his country again My recovery has not been easy he says Nothing in life thats worth anything is easy Cory is here tonight And like the Army he loves like the America he serves Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up and he does not quit My fellow Americans men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy Our freedom our democracy has never been easy Sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged But for more than two hundred years we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen The America we want for our kids a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us none of it is easy But if we work together if we summon what is best in us with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow I know its within our reach Believe itGod bless you and God bless the United States of America
Fellow citizensFor eight years it has been my honor to serve as your President The first decade of this new century has been a period of consequencea time set apart Tonight with a thankful heart I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have traveled together and the future of our nationFive days from now the world will witness the vitality of American democracy In a tradition dating back to our founding the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you the American people Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to PresidentElect Obama his wife Michelle and their two beautiful girlsTonight I am filled with gratitudeto Vice President Cheney and members of my administration to Laura who brought joy to this house and love to my life to our wonderful daughters Barbara and Jenna to my parents whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime And above all I thank the American people for the trust you have given me I thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits And I thank you for the countless acts of courage generosity and grace that I have witnessed these past eight yearsThis evening my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this houseSeptember the 11th 2001 That morning terrorists took nearly 3000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smokefilled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93 I remember Arlene Howard who gave me her fallen sons police shield as a reminder of all that was lost And I still carry his badgeAs the years passed most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 911 But I never did Every morning I received a briefing on the threats to our nation I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safeOver the past seven years a new Department of Homeland Security has been created The military the intelligence community and the FBI have been transformed Our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists movements freeze their finances and break up their plots And with strong allies at our side we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored alQaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United StatesThere is legitimate debate about many of these decisions But there can be little debate about the results America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil This is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safelaw enforcement officers intelligence analysts homeland security and diplomatic personnel and the men and women of the United States Armed ForcesOur nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families And America owes you a debt of gratitude And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight There has been no higher honor than serving as your CommanderinChiefThe battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems Under one a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology condemns women to subservience and marks unbelievers for murder The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and justice light the path to peaceThis is the belief that gave birth to our nation And in the long run advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens When people live in freedom they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror When people have hope in the future they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism So around the world America is promoting human liberty human rights and human dignity Were standing with dissidents and young democracies providing AIDS medicine to dying patientsto bring dying patients back to life and sparing mothers and babies from malaria And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nationsFor eight years weve also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home Across our country students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faithbased programs Vulnerable human life is better protected Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled Americas air and water and lands are measurably cleaner And the federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John RobertsWhen challenges to our prosperity emerged we rose to meet them Facing the prospect of a financial collapse we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy These are very tough times for hardworking families but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted All Americans are in this together And together with determination and hard work we will restore our economy to the path of growth We will show the world once again the resilience of Americas free enterprise systemLike all who have held this office before me I have experienced setbacks There are things I would do differently if given the chance Yet Ive always acted with the best interests of our country in mind I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisionsThe decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country and there are some guiding principles that should shape our courseWhile our nation is safer than it was seven years ago the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict But we have been given solemn responsibilities and we must meet them We must resist complacency We must keep our resolve And we must never let down our guardAt the same time we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose In the face of threats from abroad it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward But we must reject isolationism and its companion protectionism Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger In the 21st century security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad If America does not lead the cause of freedom that cause will not be ledAs we address these challengesand others we cannot foresee tonightAmerica must maintain our moral clarity Ive often spoken to you about good and evil and this has made some uncomfortable But good and evil are present in this world and between the two of them there can be no compromise Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time everywhere Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth We must always be willing to act in their defenseand to advance the cause of peacePresident Thomas Jefferson once wrote I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago I share that optimism America is a young country full of vitality constantly growing and renewing itself And even in the toughest times we lift our eyes to the broad horizon aheadI have confidence in the promise of America because I know the character of our people This is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger and compassion in the face of suffering We see examples of Americas character all around us And Laura and I have invited some of them to join us in the White House this eveningWe see Americas character in Dr Tony Recasner a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina We see it in Julio Medina a former inmate who leads a faithbased program to help prisoners returning to society Weve seen it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow MarinesWe see Americas character in Bill Krissoffa surgeon from California His son Nathana Marinegave his life in Iraq When I met Dr Krissoff and his family he delivered some surprising news He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son This good man was 60 years old18 years above the age limit But his petition for a waiver was granted and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight because he will soon deploy to Iraq where he will help save Americas wounded warriorsand uphold the legacy of his fallen sonIn citizens like these we see the best of our countryresilient and hopeful caring and strong These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America We have faced danger and trial and theres more ahead But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals this great nation will never tire never falter and never failIt has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President There have been good days and tough days But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people I have been blessed to represent this nation we love And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any othercitizen of the United States of AmericaAnd so my fellow Americans for the final time Good night May God bless this house and our next President And may God bless you and our wonderful country Thank you
Good morning For years Americas automakers have faced serious challenges burdensome costs a shrinking share of the market and declining profits In recent months the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe Now some US auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the federal governmentThis is a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of government On the one hand government has a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system On the other hand government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economyAddressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities If we were to allow the free market to take its course now it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers Under ordinary economic circumstances I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay and I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of businessBut these are not ordinary circumstances In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession allowing the US auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action The question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed Some argue the wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through Chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws and provide federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court But given the current state of the auto industry and the economy Chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American automakers at this timeAmerican consumers understand why If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy you worry that parts and servicing will not be available and you question the value of your warranty And with consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers it would be more difficult for auto companies to recoverAdditionally the financial crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated and they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuringThe convergence of these factors means theres too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies My economic advisors believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession And it would leave the next President to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of officeA more responsible option is to give the auto companies an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do it And that is why my administration worked with Congress on a bill to provide automakers with loans to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plans for viability This legislation earned bipartisan support from majorities in both houses of CongressUnfortunately despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcies in the American auto industry Congress was unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourning this yearThis means the only way to avoid a collapse of the US auto industry is for the executive branch to step in The American people want the auto companies to succeed and so do I So today Im announcing that the federal government will grant loans to auto companies under conditions similar to those Congress considered last weekThese loans will provide help in two ways First they will give automakers three months to put in place plans to restructure into viable companies which we believe they are capable of doing Second if restructuring cannot be accomplished outside of bankruptcy the loans will provide time for companies to make the legal and financial preparations necessary for an orderly Chapter 11 process that offers a better prospect of longterm success and gives consumers confidence that they can continue to buy American carsBecause Congress failed to make funds available for these loans the plan Im announcing today will be drawn from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this fall The terms of the loans will require auto companies to demonstrate how they would become viable They must pay back all their loans to the government and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth This restructuring will require meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry management labor unions creditors bondholders dealers and suppliersIn particular automakers must meet conditions that experts agree are necessary for longterm viability including putting their retirement plans on a sustainable footing persuading bondholders to convert their debt into capital the companies need to address immediate financial shortfalls and making their compensation competitive with foreign automakers who have major operations in the United States If a company fails to come up with a viable plan by March 31st it will be required to repay its federal loansThe automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform These conditions send a clear message to everyone involved in the future of American automakers The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now or the only option will be bankruptcyThe actions Im announcing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary But given the situation it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge facing our nation By giving the auto companies a chance to restructure we will shield the American people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time And we will give American workers an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than beforeThank you
Thank you very much Please be seated Thank you Larry thank you for the introduction Thank you for giving Laura and me a chance to come to this historic hall to talk about a big issue facing the world And today I appreciate you giving me a chance to come and for me to outline the steps that America and our partners are taking and are going to take to overcome this financial crisisAnd I thank the Manhattan Institute for all you have done I appreciate the fact that I am here in a fabulous city to give this speech People say are you confident about our future And the answer is absolutely And its easy to be confident when youre a city like New York City After all theres an unbelievable spirit in this city This is a city whose skyline has offered immigrants their first glimpse of freedom This is a city where people rallied when that freedom came under attack This is a city whose capital markets have attracted investments from around the world and financed the dreams of entrepreneurs all across America This is a city that has been and will always be the financial capital of the world And I am grateful to be in the presence of two men who serve ably and nobly New York City Mayor Koch and Mayor Giuliani Thank you all for coming Glad youre here I thank the Manhattan Institute Board of Trustees and its Chairman Paul Singer for doing good work being a good policy center And before I begin I must say I would hope that Ray Kelly would tell New Yorks finest how much I appreciate the incredible hospitality that we are always shown here in New York City Youre the head of a fabulous police force and we thank you very much sir We live in a world in which our economies are interconnected Prosperity and progress have reached farther than any time in our history Unfortunately as we have seen in recent months financial turmoil anywhere in the world affects economies everywhere in the world And so this weekend Im going to host a Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy with leaders from developed and developing nations that account for nearly 90 percent of the world economy Leaders of the World Bank the International Monetary Fund the United Nations and the Financial Stability Forum are going to be there as well Well have dinner at the White House tomorrow night and well meet most of the day on SaturdayThe leaders attending this weekends meeting agree on a clear purpose to address the current crisis and to lay the foundation for reforms that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future We also agree that this undertaking is too large to be accomplished in a single session The issues are too complex the problem is too significant to try to solve or to come up with reasonable recommendations in just one meeting So this summit will be the first of a series of meetingsIt will focus on five key objectives understanding the causes of the global crisis reviewing the effectiveness of our responses thus far developing principles for reforming our financial and regulatory systems launching a specific action plan to implement those principles and reaffirming our conviction that free market principles offer the surest path to lasting prosperity First were working toward a common understanding of the causes behind the global crisis Different countries will naturally bring different perspectives but there are some points on which we can all agreeOver the past decade the world experienced a period of strong economic growth Nations accumulated huge amounts of savings and looked for safe places to invest them Because of our attractive political legal and entrepreneurial climates the United States and other developed nations received a large share of that moneyThe massive inflow of foreign capital combined with low interest rates produced a period of easy credit And that easy credit especially affected the housing market Flush with cash many lenders issued mortgages and many borrowers could not afford them Financial institutions then purchased these loans packaged them together and converted them into complex securities designed to yield large returns These securities were then purchased by investors and financial institutions in the United States and Europe and elsewhere often with little analysis of their true underlying valueThe financial crisis was ignited when booming housing markets began to decline As home values dropped many borrowers defaulted on their mortgages and institutions holding securities backed by those mortgages suffered serious losses Because of outdated regulatory structures and poor risk management practices many financial institutions in America and Europe were too highly leveraged When capital ran short many faced severe financial jeopardy This led to highprofile failures of financial institutions in America and Europe led to contractions and widespread anxiety all of which contributed to sharp declines in the equity marketsThese developments have placed a heavy burden on hardworking people around the world Stock market drops have eroded the value of retirement accounts and pension funds The tightening of credit has made it harder for families to borrow money for cars or home improvements or education of the children Businesses have found it harder to get loans to expand their operations and create jobs Many nations have suffered job losses and have serious concerns about the worsening economy Developing nations have been hit hard as nervous investors have withdrawn their capitalWe are faced with the prospect of a global meltdown And so weve responded with bold measures Im a marketoriented guy but not when Im faced with the prospect of a global meltdown At Saturdays summit were going to review the effectiveness of our actionsHere in the United States we have taken unprecedented steps to boost liquidity recapitalize financial institutions guarantee most new debt issued by insured banks and prevent the disorderly collapse of large interconnected enterprises These were historic actions taken necessary to make necessary so that the economy would not melt down and affect millions of our fellow citizensIn Europe governments are also purchasing equity in banks and providing government guarantees for loans In Asia nations like China and Japan and South Korea have lowered interest rates and have launched significant economic stimulus plans In the Middle East nations like Kuwait and the UAE have guaranteed deposits and opened up new government lending to banksIn addition nations around the world have taken unprecedented joint measures Last month a number of central banks carried out a coordinated interest rate cut The Federal Reserve is extending needed liquidity to central banks around the world The IMF and World Bank are working to ensure that developing nations can weather this crisisThis crisis did not develop overnight and its not going to be solved overnight But our actions are having an impact Credit markets are beginning to thaw Businesses are gaining access to essential shortterm financing A measure of stability is returning to financial systems here at home and around the world Its going to require more time for these improvements to fully take hold and theres going to be difficult days ahead But the United States and our partner are taking the right steps to get through this crisisIn addition to addressing the current crisis we will also need to make broader reforms to strengthen the global economy over the long term This weekend leaders will establish principles for adapting our financial systems to the realities of the 21st century marketplace We will discuss specific actions we can take to implement these principles We will direct our finance ministers to work with other experts and report back to us with detailed recommendations on further reasonable actionsOne vital principle of reform is that our nations must make our financial markets more transparent For example we should consider improving accounting rules for securities so that investors around the world can understand the true value of the assets they purchaseSecondly we must ensure that markets firms and financial products are properly regulated For example credit default swaps financial products that insure against potential losses should be processed through centralized clearinghouses instead of through unregulated over the counter markets By bringing greater stability to this large and important financial sector we reduce the risk to our overall financial systemsThird we must enhance the integrity of our financial markets For example authorities in every nation should take a fresh look at the rules governing market manipulation and fraud and ensure that investors are properly protectedFourth we must strengthen cooperation among the worlds financial authorities For example leading nations should better coordinate national laws and regulations We should also reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank which are based largely on the economic order of 1944 To better reflect the realities of todays global economy both the IMF and World Bank should modernize their governance structures They should consider extending greater voter voting power to dynamic developing nations especially as they increase their contributions to these institutions They should consider ways to streamline their executive boards and make them more representativeIn addition to these important to these management changes we should move forward with other reforms to make the IMF and World Bank more transparent accountable and effective For example the IMF should agree to work more closely with member countries to ensure that their exchange rate policies are marketoriented and fair And the World Bank should ensure its development programs reflect the priorities of the people they are designed to serve and focus on measurable resultsAll these steps require decisive actions from governments around the world At the same time we must recognize that government intervention is not a cureall For example some blame the crisis on insufficient regulation of the American mortgage market But many European countries had much more extensive regulations and still experienced problems almost identical to our ownHistory has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market it is too much government involvement in the market We saw this in the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Because these firms were chartered by the United States Congress many believed they were backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government Investors put huge amounts of money into Fannie and Freddie which they used to build up irresponsibly large portfolios of mortgagebacked securities And when the housing market declined these securities of course plummeted in value It took a taxpayerfunded rescue to keep Fannie and Freddie from collapsing in a way that would have devastated the global financial system And there is a clear lesson Our aim should not be more government it should be smarter governmentAll this leads to the most important principle that should guide our work While reforms in the financial sector are essential the longterm solution to todays problems is sustained economic growth And the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people This is a decisive moment for the global economy In the wake of the financial crisis voices from the left and right are equating the free enterprise system with greed and exploitation and failure Its true this crisis included failures by lenders and borrowers and by financial firms and by governments and independent regulators But the crisis was not a failure of the free market system And the answer is not to try to reinvent that system It is to fix the problems we face make the reforms we need and move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globeLike any other system designed by man capitalism is not perfect It can be subject to excesses and abuse But it is by far the most efficient and just way of structuring an economy At its most basic level capitalism offers people the freedom to choose where they work and what they do the opportunity to buy or sell products they want and the dignity that comes with profiting from their talent and hard work The free market system provides the incentives that lead to prosperity the incentive to work to innovate to save to invest wisely and to create jobs for others And as millions of people pursue these incentives together whole societies benefitFree market capitalism is far more than economic theory It is the engine of social mobility the highway to the American Dream Its what makes it possible for a husband and wife to start their own business or a new immigrant to open a restaurant or a single mom to go back to college and to build a better career It is what allowed entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to change the way the world sells products and searches for information Its what transformed America from a rugged frontier to the greatest economic power in history a nation that gave the world the steamboat and the airplane the computer and the CAT scan the Internet and the iPodUltimately the best evidence for free market capitalism is its performance compared to other economic systems Free markets allowed Japan an island with few natural resources to recover from war and grow into the worlds secondlargest economy Free markets allowed South Korea to make itself into one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world Free markets turned small areas like Singapore and Hong Kong and Taiwan into global economic players Today the success of the worlds largest economies comes from their embrace of free marketsMeanwhile nations that have pursued other models have experienced devastating results Soviet communism starved millions bankrupted an empire and collapsed as decisively as the Berlin Wall Cuba once known for its vast fields of cane is now forced to ration sugar And while Iran sits atop giant oil reserves its people cannot put enough gasoline in its in their carsThe record is unmistakable If you seek economic growth if you seek opportunity if you seek social justice and human dignity the free market system is the way to go And it would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of successJust as important as maintaining free markets within countries is maintaining the free movement of goods and services between countries When nations open their markets to trade and investment their businesses and farmers and workers find new buyers for their products Consumers benefit from more choices and better prices Entrepreneurs can get their ideas off the ground with funding from anywhere in the world Thanks in large part to open markets the volume of global trade today is nearly 30 times greater than it was six decades ago and some of the most dramatic gains have come in the developing worldAs President I have seen the transformative power of trade up close Ive been to a Caterpillar factory in East Peoria Illinois where thousands of goodpaying American jobs are supported by exports Ive walked the grounds of a trade fair in Ghana where I met women who support their families by exporting handmade dresses and jewelry Ive spoken with a farmer in Guatemala who decided to grow highvalue crops he could sell overseas and helped create more than 1000 jobsStories like these show why it is so important to keep markets open to trade and investment This openness is especially urgent during times of economic strain Shortly after the stock market crash in 1929 Congress passed the SmootHawley tariff a protectionist measure designed to wall off Americas economy from global competition The result was not economic security It was economic ruin And leaders around the world must keep this example in mind and reject the temptation of protectionism There are clearcut ways for nations to demonstrate the commitment to open markets The United States Congress has an immediate opportunity by approving free trade agreements with Colombia Peru and South Korea America and other wealthy nations must also ensure this crisis does not become an excuse to reverse our engagement with the developing world And developing nations should continue policies that foster enterprise and investment As well all nations should pledge to conclude a framework this year that leads to a successful Doha agreementWere facing this challenge together and were going to get through it together The United States is determined to show the way back to economic growth and prosperity I know some may question whether Americas leadership in the global economy will continue The world can be confident that it will because our markets are flexible and we can rebound from setbacks We saw that resilience in the 1940s when America pulled itself out of Depression marshaled a powerful army and helped save the world from tyranny We saw that resilience in the 1980s when Americans overcame gas lines turned stagflation into strong economic growth and won the Cold War We saw that resilience after September the 11th 2001 when our nation recovered from a brutal attack revitalized our shaken economy and rallied the forces of freedom in the great ideological struggle of the 21st centuryThe world will see the resilience of America once again We will work with our partners to correct the problems in the global financial system We will rebuild our economic strength And we will continue to lead the world toward prosperity and peaceThanks for coming and God bless 
A short time ago the House of Representatives passed a bill that is essential to helping Americas economy weather the financial crisis The Senate passed the same legislation on Wednesday night And when Congress sends me the final bill Im going to sign it into lawThere were moments this week when some thought the federal government could not rise to the challenge But thanks to the hard work of members of both parties in both Houses and a spirit of cooperation between Capitol Hill and my administration we completed this bill in a timely manner Im especially grateful for the contributions of Speaker Nancy Pelosi Minority Leader John Boehner Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Minority Whip Roy Blunt Chairman Barney Frank Ranking Member Spencer BachusBy coming together on this legislation we have acted boldly to help prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country We have shown the world that the United States of America will stabilize our financial markets and maintain a leading role in the global economyA major problem in our financial system is that banks have restricted the flow of credit to businesses and consumers many of the assets these banks are holding have lost value The legislation Congress passed today addresses this problem head on by providing a variety of new tools to the government such as allowing us to purchase some of the troubled assets and creating a new government insurance program that will guarantee the value of others The bill also ensures that these new programs are carried out in a way that protects taxpayers It prevents failed executives from receiving windfalls from taxpayers dollars It establishes a bipartisan board to oversee the plans implementationTaken together these steps represent decisive action to ease the credit crunch that is now threatening our economy With a smoother flow of credit more businesses will be able to stock their shelves and meet their payrolls More families will be able to get loans for cars and homes and college education More state and local governments will be able to fund basic servicesThe bill includes other provisions to help American consumers and businesses It includes tax incentives for businesses to invest and create jobs It temporarily expands federal insurance for bank and credit union deposits from 100000 to 250000 a vital safeguard for consumers and small businesses It provides families with relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax which would otherwise increase taxes for 26 million taxpayers by an average of 2200I know some Americans have concerns about this legislation especially about the governments role and the bills cost As a strong supporter of free enterprise I believe government intervention should occur only when necessary In this situation action is clearly necessary And ultimately the cost ultimately the cost to taxpayers will be far less than the initial outlay See the government will purchase troubled assets and once the market recovers it is likely that many of the assets will go up in value And over time Americans should expect that much if not all of the tax dollars we invest will be paid backAmericans should also expect that it will take some time for this legislation to have its full impact on our economy Exercising the authorities in this bill in a responsible way will require a careful analysis and deliberation This will be done as expeditiously as possible but it cannot be accomplished overnight Well take the time necessary to design an effective program that achieves its objectives and does not waste taxpayer dollarsOur economy continues to face serious challenges This morning we learned that America lost jobs again in September disappointing news that underscores the urgency of the bill that Congress passed today It will take more time and determined effort to get through this difficult period But with confidence and leadership and bipartisan cooperation well overcome the challenges we face return our nation to a path of growth and job creation and longterm economic prosperity Thank you
Thank you all Deputy Secretary England thanks for the introduction One boss may not be here but the other one is I appreciate your kind words Im pleased to be back here with the men and women of the Defense DepartmentOn this day in 2003 the United States began Operation Iraqi Freedom As the campaign unfolded tens and thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqi people and remove a regime that threatened free nationsFive years into this battle there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting whether the fight is worth winning and whether we can win it The answers are clear to me Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision and this is a fight America can and must winThe men and women who crossed into Iraq 5 years ago removed a tyrant liberated a country and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors Some of those troops are with us today and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment and so is the Commander in ChiefI appreciate Admiral Mullen the Joint Chiefs who are here Thanks for coming Secretary Donald Winter of the Navy Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us Admiral Thad Allen of the Coast Guard is with us Ambassador from Iraq is with us Mr Ambassador were proud to have you here Soldiers sailors marines airmen and coast mencoast guard men thanks for coming thanks for wearing the uniform Men and women of the Department of State are here as wellOperation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness Forces from the UK Australia Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations As they advanced our troops fought their way through sandstorms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky Our troops engaged in pitched battles with Fedayeen Saddam death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians They used women and children as human shields They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing but they couldnt stop the coalition advanceAided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history coalition forces raced across 350 miles of enemy territory destroying Republican Guard divisions pushing through the Karbala Gap capturing Saddam International Airport and liberating Baghdad in less than 1 monthAlong the way our troops added new chapters to the story of American military heroism During these first weeks of battle Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith and his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican Guard forces Sergeant Smith rallied his men He led a counterattack killing as many as 50 enemy soldiers before being fatally wounded His actions saved the lives of more than a hundred American troops and earned him the Medal of HonorToday in light of the challenges we have faced in Iraq some look back at this period as the easy part of the war Yet there was nothing easy about it The liberation of Iraq took incredible skill and amazing courage And the speed precision and brilliant execution of the campaign will be studied by military historians for years to comeWhat our troops found in Iraq following Saddams removal was horrifying They uncovered childrens prisons and torture chambers and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated in front of their families They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemed disloyal to Saddam And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves of thousands executed by the regimeBecause we acted Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men women and children Because we acted Saddams torture chambers and rape rooms and childrens prisons have been closed for good Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer paying the families of suicide bombers in the Holy Land Because we acted Saddams regime is no longer shooting at American and British aircraft patrolling the nofly zones and defying the will of the United Nations Because we acted the world is better and United States of America is saferWhen the Iraqi regime was removed it did not lay down its arms and surrender Instead former regime elements took off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight the emergence of a free Iraq And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking to stop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe havens from which to plot new attacks across the worldThe battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated but it is a fight we must win So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage and determination And as theyve battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq they have helped the Iraqi people reclaim their nation and helped a young democracy rise from the rubble of Saddam Husseins tyrannyOver the past 5 years we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls and chose their leaders in free elections We watched in horror as Al Qaida beheaded innocent captives and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq and they serve as a grim reminder The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we will face the enemy here at homeA little over a year ago the fight in Iraq was faltering Extremist elements were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos They had established safe havens in many parts of the country They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines And their strategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was working as pressures built here in Washington for withdrawal before the job was doneMy administration understood that America could not retreat in the face of terror And we knew that if we did not act the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen and spread and could eventually reach genocidal levels Baghdad could have disintegrated into a contagion of killing and Iraq could have descended into fullblown sectarian warfareSo we reviewed the strategy and changed course in Iraq We sent reinforcements into the country in a dramatic policy shift that is now known as the surge General David Petraeus took command with a new mission Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people pressure the enemy into strongholds and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country And that is precisely what we have doneIn Anbar Sunni tribal leaders had grown tired of Al Qaidas brutality and started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening To take advantage of this opportunity we sent 4000 additional marines to help these brave Iraqis drive Al Qaida from the Province As this effort succeeded it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight Soon similar uprisings began to spread across the country Today there are more than 90000 concerned local citizens who are protecting their communities from the terrorists and insurgents and the extremists The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward with a surge of its own theyve added more than 100000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year These Iraqi troops have fought bravely and thousands have given their lives in this struggleTogether these Americans and Iraqi forces have driven the terrorists from many of the sanctuaries they once held Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them There will be tough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead But theres no doubt in my mind because of the courage of our troops and the bravery of the Iraqis the Al Qaida terrorists in this region will suffer the same fate as Al Qaida suffered elsewhere in IraqAs we have fought Al Qaida coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shia extremist groups many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran A year ago these groups were on the rise Today they are increasingly isolated and Iraqis of all faiths are putting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their young democracyTo ensure that military progress in Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life we have doubled the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq These teams of civilian experts are serving all Iraqi18 Iraqi Provinces and theyre helping to strengthen responsible leaders and build up local economies and bring Iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up Theyre very effective Theyre helping give ordinary Iraqis confidence that by rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another they can claim their place in a free Iraq and build better lives for their familiesTheres still hard work to be done in Iraq The gains we have made are fragile and reversible But on this anniversary the American people should know that since the surge began the level of violence is significantly down civilian deaths are down sectarian killings are down attacks on American forces are down We have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives Our men and women in uniform are performing with characteristic honor and valor The surge is working And as a return on our success in Iraq weve begun bringing some of our troops homeThe surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror For the terrorists Iraq was supposed to be the place where Al Qaida rallied Arab masses to drive America out Instead Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive Al Qaida out In Iraq we are witnessing the first largescale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden his grim ideology and his murderous network And the significance of this development cannot be overstatedThe terrorist movement feeds on a sense of inevitability and claims to rise on the tide of history The accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting the extremists When Iraqi and American forces finish the job the effects will reverberate far beyond Iraqs borders Usama bin Laden once said When people see a strong horse and a weak horse by nature they will like the strong horse By defeating Al Qaida in Iraq we will show the world that Al Qaida is the weak horse We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the terrorists And we will show that the future of the Middle East does not belong to terror The future of the Middle East belongs to freedomThe challenge in this period ahead is to consolidate the gains we have made and seal the extremists defeat We have learned through hard experience what happens when we pull our forces back too fast the terrorists and extremists step in they fill vacuums establish safe havens and use them to spread chaos and carnage General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling with Al Qaida and insurgents and militia extremists regaining lost ground and increasing violenceMen and women of the Armed Forces Having come so far and achieved so much were not going to let this to happenNext month General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington to testify before Congress I will await their recommendations before making decisions on our troop levels in Iraq Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendations of our commanders And they must not jeopardize the hardfought gains our troops and civilians have made over the past yearSuccesses we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable yet some in Washington still call for retreat War critics can no longer credibly argue that were losing in Iraq so they now argue the war costs too much In recent months weve heard exaggerated amounts of the costs of this war No one arewould argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in IraqIf we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq the violence that is now declining would accelerate and Iraq would descend into chaos Al Qaida would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraqs borders with serious consequences for the worlds economyOut of such chaos in Iraq the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened with new recruits new resources and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America An emboldened Al Qaida with access to Iraqs oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations Iran would be emboldened as well with a renewed determination to develop nuclear weapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle East Our enemies would see an Americaan American failure in Iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolveTo allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make it more likely that America would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day a day in which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3000 people in ouron our soil a day after which in the following of that attack more than a million Americans lost work lost their jobs The terrorists intend even greater harm to our country And we have no greater responsibility than to defeat our enemies across the world so that they cannot carry out such an attackAs our coalition fights the enemy in Iraq weve stayed on the offensive on other fronts in the war on terror You know just a few weeks after commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom US forces captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind behind the September the 11th terrorist attacks we got him in Pakistan About the same time as we launched Operation Iraqi Freedom coalition forces thousands ofhundreds of miles away launched an assault on the terrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an operation called Operation Valiant StrikeThroughout the war on terror we have brought the enemywe have fought the enemy on every single battlefront And so long as terrorist danger remains the United States of America will continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its standWe will stay on the offense But in the long run defeating the terrorists requires an alternative to their murderous ideology And there we have another advantage Weve got a singular advantage with our military when it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice And we have another advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of libertySo were helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East A free Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them A free Iraq will be an example for others of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with hope By spreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East we will help free societies take root And when they do freedom will yield the peace that we all desireOur troops on the frontlines understand what is at stake They know that the mission in Iraq has been difficult and has been trying for our Nation because theyre the ones whove carried most of the burdens Theyre all volunteers who have stepped forward to defend America in a time of danger Some of them have gone out of their way to return to the fightOne of these brave Americans is a Marine Gunnery Sergeant named William Spanky Gibson In May of 2006 in Ramadi a terrorist snipers bullet ripped through his left knee doctors then amputated his leg After months of difficult rehabilitation Spanky was not only walking he was training for triathlonsLast year at the Escape from Alcatraz swim near San Francisco he met Marine General James Mattis who asked if theres anything he could do for him Spanky had just one request He asked to redeploy to Iraq Today hes serving in Fallujah the first fullleg amputee to return to the frontlines Heres what he says about his decision to return The Iraqis whereare where we were 232 years ago as a nation Now theyre starting a new nation and thats one of my big reasons for coming back here I wanted to tell the people of this country that Im back to help wherever I canWhen Americans like Spanky Gibson serve on our side the enemy in Iraq doesnt got a chance Were grateful to all the brave men and women of our military who have served the cause of freedom Youve done the hard work far from home and far from your loved ones We give thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this missionWe appreciate the fine civilians from many Departments who serve alongside you Many of you served in Iraq and Afghanistan and some have been on these fronts several times You will never forget the people who fought at your side You will always remember the comrades who served with you in combat but did not make the journey home America remembers them as well More than 4400 men and women have given their lives in the war on terror Well pray for their families Well always honor their memoryThe best way we can honor them is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain Five years ago tonight I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead we will accept no outcome but victory Today standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation I reaffirm the commitment The battle in Iraq is noble it is necessary and it is just And with your courage the battle in Iraq will end in victory God bless
Madam Speaker Vice President Cheney members of Congress distinguished guests and fellow citizensSeven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum In that time our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined We faced hard decisions about peace and war rising competition in the world economy and the health and welfare of our citizens These issues call for vigorous debate and I think its fair to say weve answered the call Yet history will record that amid our differences we acted with purpose and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American selfgovernmentAll of us were sent to Washington to carry out the peoples business That is the purpose of this body It is the meaning of our oath It remains our charge to keepThe actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended In this election year let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same timeFrom expanding opportunity to protecting our country weve made good progress Yet we have unfinished business before us and the American people expect us to get it doneIn the work ahead we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great As Americans we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens And so in all we do we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futuresTo build a prosperous future we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy As we meet tonight our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months but jobs are now growing at a slower pace Wages are up but so are prices for food and gas Exports are rising but the housing market has declined At kitchen tables across our country there is a concern about our economic futureIn the long run Americans can be confident about our economic growth But in the short run we can all see that that growth is slowing So last week my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment The temptation will be to load up the bill That would delay it or derail it and neither option is acceptable This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working and this Congress must pass it as soon as possibleWe have other work to do on taxes Unless Congress acts most of the tax relief weve delivered over the past seven years will be taken away Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of 1800 Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes I welcome their enthusiasm Im pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money ordersMost Americans think their taxes are high enough With all the other pressures on their finances American families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks Theres only one way to eliminate this uncertainty Make the tax relief permanent And members of Congress should know if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk I will veto itJust as we trust Americans with their own money we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely Next week Ill send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than 18 billion The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012 American families have to balance their budgets so should their governmentThe peoples trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute without discussion or debate Last year I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote Unfortunately neither goal was met So this time if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half Ill send it back to you with my vetoAnd tomorrow I will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress If these items are truly worth funding Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public voteOur shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending On housing we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure And Congress can help even more Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac modernize the Federal Housing Administration and allow state housing agencies to issue taxfree bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages These are difficult times for many American families and by taking these steps we can help more of them keep their homesTo build a future of quality health care we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options We share a common goal making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice not government control So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions and I call on the Congress to pass it this yearThe Congress must also expand health savings accounts create association health plans for small businesses promote health information technology and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits With all these steps we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctors office not in the halls of CongressOn education we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower parents to demand results from our schools In neighborhoods across our country there are boys and girls with dreams and a decent education is their only hope of achieving themSix years ago we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act and today no one can deny its results Last year fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record Reading scores are on the rise AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students posted alltime highs Now we must work together to increase accountability add flexibilities for states and districts reduce the number of high school dropouts provide extra help for struggling schoolsMembers of Congress the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement It is succeeding And we owe it to Americas children their parents and their teachers to strengthen this good lawWe must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved more than 2600 of the poorest children in our nations capital have found new hope at a faithbased or other nonpublic school Sadly these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of Americas inner cities So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning And to open the doors of these schools to more children I ask you to support a new 300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids We have seen how Pell Grants help lowincome college students realize their full potential Together weve expanded the size and reach of these grants Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schoolsOn trade we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas Today our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world So were working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can Were working for a successful Doha round of trade talks and we must complete a good agreement this year At the same time were pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreementsI thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea Many products from these nations now enter America duty free yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets These agreements will level the playing field They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world those whose products say Made in the USAThese agreements also promote Americas strategic interests The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers If we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere So we must come together pass this agreement and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better lifeTrade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices Yet for some Americans trade can mean losing a job and the federal government has a responsibility to help I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobsTo build a future of energy security we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology Our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oilLast year I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade and you responded Together we should take the next steps Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissionsfree nuclear power Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future Let us create a new international clean technology fund which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gasesThis agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technologyTo keep America competitive into the future we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow Last year Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative but never followed through with the funding This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge So I ask Congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on EarthOn matters of life and science we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries In November we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human lifeSo were expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research And as we explore promising avenues of research we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying selling patenting or cloning of human lifeOn matters of justice we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says Ive submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law not the whim of the gavel Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed They are worthy of confirmation and the Senate should give each of them a prompt upordown voteIn communities across our land we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need Over the past seven years more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service Americans have volunteered in record numbers Charitable donations are higher than ever Faithbased groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair with newfound support from the federal government And to help guarantee equal treatment of faithbased organizations when they compete for federal funds I ask you to permanently extend charitable choiceTonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before And tonight Im pleased to announce that in April we will host this years North American Summit of Canada Mexico and the United States in the great city of New OrleansThere are two other pressing challenges that Ive raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address entitlement spending and immigration Every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security Medicare and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path massive tax increases sudden and drastic cuts in benefits or crippling deficits Ive laid out proposals to reform these programs Now I ask members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildrenThe other pressing challenge is immigration America needs to secure our borders and with your help my administration is taking steps to do so Were increasing worksite enforcement deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings Weve effectively ended the policy of catchandrelease at the border and by the end of this year we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harmWe must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally Illegal immigration is complicated but it can be resolved And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest idealsThis is the business of our nation here at home Yet building a prosperous future for our citizen also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the worldOur foreign policy is based on a clear premise We trust that people when given the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace In the last seven years we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty Weve seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections Weve seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence Weve seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new Parliament Weve seen jubilant Iraqis holding up inkstained fingers and celebrating their freedom These images of liberty have inspired usIn the past seven years weve also seen the images that have sobered us Weve watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassins hand Weve seen wedding guests in bloodsoaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs On a clear September day we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant These horrific images serve as a grim reminder The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists evil men who despise freedom despise America and aim to subject millions to their violent ruleSince 911 we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists We will stay on the offense we will keep up the pressure and we will deliver justice to our enemiesWe are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear Yet in this war on terror there is one thing we and our enemies agree on In the long run men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan and the Palestinian Territories And that is why for the security of America and the peace of the world we are spreading the hope of freedomIn Afghanistan America our 25 NATO allies and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school new roads and hospitals are being built and people are looking to the future with new hope These successes must continue so were adding 3200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda is critical to our security and I thank the Congress for supporting Americas vital mission in AfghanistanIn Iraq the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world One year ago our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos So we reviewed our strategy and changed course We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq We gave our troops a new mission Work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people pursue the enemy in its strongholds and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the countryThe Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods clearing out the terrorists and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return And they saw our troops along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction and they have the gratitude of our whole nationThe Iraqis launched a surge of their own In the fall of 2006 Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaedas brutality started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening Over the past year similar movements have spread across the country And today the grassroots surge includes more than 80000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists The government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well adding more than 100000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past yearWhile the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago When we met last year many said that containing the violence was impossible A year later highprofile terrorist attacks are down civilian deaths are down sectarian killings are downWhen we met last year militia extremistssome armed and trained by Iranwere wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq A year later coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their countryWhen we met last year Al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country Today it is Al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held And over the past year weve captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq including hundreds of key Al Qaeda leaders and operativesLast month Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq Ladies and gentlemen some may deny the surge is working but among the terrorists there is no doubt Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq and this enemy will be defeatedWhen we met last year our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise Today because of the progress just described we are implementing a policy of return on success and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come homeThis progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines Soldiers and sailors airmen marines and coast guardsmen In the past year you have done everything weve asked of you and more Our nation is grateful for your courage We are proud of your accomplishments And tonight in this hallowed chamber with the American people as our witness we make you a solemn pledge In the fight ahead you will have all you need to protect our nation And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troopsOur enemies in Iraq have been hit hard They are not yet defeated and we can still expect tough fighting ahead Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and eventually to a protective overwatch mission As part of this transition one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced In the coming months four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit Taken together this means more than 20000 of our troops are coming homeAny further drawdown of US troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in quote the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces Al QaedaIraq regaining lost ground and a marked increase in violence Members of Congress having come so far and achieved so much we must not allow this to happenIn the coming year we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress theyre making toward political reconciliation At the local level Sunnis Shia and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives Progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad Were seeing some encouraging signs The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces The Parliament recently passed both a pension law and deBaathification reform Theyre now debating a provincial powers law The Iraqis still have a distance to travel but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence reconciliation is taking place and the Iraqi people are taking control of their futureThe mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation But it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed A free Iraq will deny Al Qaeda a safe haven A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible A free Iraq will be a friend of America a partner in fighting terror and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the worldBy contrast a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists strengthen Iran and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends our allies and our homeland The enemy has made its intentions clear At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them Al Qaedas top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington My fellow Americans we will not rest either We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated We must do the difficult work today so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment prevailed in a tough fight and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer AmericaWere also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land where we have new cause for hope Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem I assured leaders from both sides that America will do and I will do everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peaceWere also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran Irans rulers oppress a good and talented people And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium which could be used to create a nuclear weaponOur message to the people of Iran is clear We have no quarrel with you We respect your traditions and your history We look forward to the day when you have your freedom Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin And to rejoin the community of nations come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions stop your oppression at home cease your support for terror abroad But above all know this America will confront those who threaten our troops we will stand by our allies and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian GulfOn the homefront we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country This is our most solemn duty We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 911 This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy In the past six years weve stopped numerous attacks including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic Dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans These good citizens are saving American lives and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanksAnd we owe them something more we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications To protect America we need to know who the terrorists are talking to what they are saying and what theyre planning Last year Congress passed legislation to help us do that Unfortunately Congress set the legislations to expire on February 1 That means if you dont act by Friday our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America Weve had ample time for debate The time to act is nowProtecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair So America is using its influence to build a freer more hopeful and more compassionate world This is a reflection of our national interests it is the calling of our conscienceAmerica opposes genocide in Sudan We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and BurmaAmerica is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance Weve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account This program strengthens democracy transparency and the rule of law in developing nations and I ask you to fully fund this important initiativeAmerica is leading the fight against global hunger Today more than half the worlds food aid comes from the United States And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famineAmerica is leading the fight against disease With your help were working to cut by half the number of malariarelated deaths in 15 African nations And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 14 million people We can bring healing and hope to many more So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIVAIDS by approving an additional 30 billion over the next five yearsAmerica is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace Over the past seven years weve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent And as we increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignityOur military families also sacrifice for America They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home We have a responsibility to provide for them So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children Our military families serve our nation they inspire our nation and tonight our nation honors themThe strengththe secret of our strength the miracle of America is that our greatness lies not in our government but in the spirit and determination of our people When the federal convention met in Philadelphia in 1787 our nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation which began with the words We the undersigned delegates When Governor Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world We the peopleBy trusting the people our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women By trusting the people succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions And so long as we continue to trust the people our nation will prosper our liberty will be secure and the state of our Union will remain strongSo tonight with confidence in freedoms power and trust in the people let us set forth to do their business God bless America

wonderful day we celebrate our history our heroes our heritage our great American flag and our freedom Happy Fourth of July to everyone I want to thank the US Army Golden Knights for that truly aweinspiring display Tremendous talent The Golden Knights and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nationTwo hundred and fortyfour years ago in Philadelphia the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth that we are all made equal by God Thanks to the courage of those patriots of July 4th 1776 the American Republic stands today as the greatest most exceptional and most virtuous nation in the history of the worldOur workers our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity Our artists architects and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty American heroes defeated the Nazis dethroned the fascists toppled the communists saved American values upheld American principles and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the Earth We are now in the process of defeating the radical left the Marxists the anarchists the agitators the looters and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing Our inventors scientists doctors and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions all around the world Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the Moon and America will be the first nation to land on Mars All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth We inherit their towering confidence unwavering enthusiasm their unbridled ambition and their unrelenting optimism This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriotThat is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names are etched on our monuments and memorials and in the pages of history and in the hearts of a very grateful peopleWe will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues erase our history indoctrinate our children or trample on our freedoms We will safeguard our values traditions customs and beliefs We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future Together we will fight for the American Dream and we will defend protect and preserve American way of life which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by the same countriesBut there and then we got hit by the virus that came from China And weve made a lot of progress our strategy is moving along well It goes out in one area and rears back its ugly face in another area But weve learned a lot Weve learned how to put out the flame Weve made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands to the point that we have far more than we need and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries as a gesture of goodwillLikewise testing there were no tests for a new virus but now we have tested over 40 million people But by so doing we show cases 99 percent of which are totally harmless Results that no other country will show because no other country has testing that we have not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the qualityAnd now just like everything else we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators we have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world and are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country where heretofore it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands in particular China where ironically this virus and others came from Chinas secrecy deceptions and coverup allowed it to spread all over the world 189 countries and China must be held fully accountable With respect to remedies we are now doing unbelievably well and are in deep testing on vaccines treatments and therapeutics I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver lifesaving treatments and ultimately a vaccineWe are unleashing our nations scientific brilliance And well likely have a therapeutic andor vaccine solution long before the end of the year Were grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the frontlines to kill the virus I just want to say that America thanks you Please stand Please Thank you very much Great brilliant people These are great and brilliant people Thank you And brave people Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest Godgiven potentialNever forget We are one family and one nation This rich heritage belongs to every citizen young and old firstgeneration American and tenthgeneration American This heritage belongs to every citizen young and old firstgeneration American we want to go from first generation to tenth generation it matters not We are American We are from the USA This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life No matter our race color religion or creed we are one America and we put America first We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background We will not allow them to foment hate discord and distrust We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors as Americans and as patriotsIn every age there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present Those that are lying about our history those who want us to be ashamed of who we are are not interested in justice or in healing Their goal is demolition Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth what we have built The United States of America To build a future where every family is safe where every child is surrounded by love where every community has equal opportunity and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignityOur past is not a burden to be cast away it is a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor The incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished linked by time by fate and the eternal bonds of our national affectionThose who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom the courage the love and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow We cannot let that happen We will not throw away our heroes We will honor them and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice These are great heroesLet me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity Thats what our people are doing We want a clear and faithful defense of American history and we want unityWhen you level these false charges you not only slander me you not only slander the American people but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America You slander people much braver and much more principled than you You are slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War You slander them You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression They didnt fight for those things they fought for the exact opposite We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by youThe more you lie the more you slander the more you try to demean and divide the more we will work hard to tell the truth And we will win The more you lie and demean and collude the more credibility you lose We want to bring the country together and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one Our country will be united After all what do we want We want a strong military great education housing low taxes law and order We want safety we want equal justice we want religious liberty we want faith and family and living in a great communities and happy communities and safe communities And we want great jobs and we want to be respected by the rest of the world not taken advantage of by the rest of the world which has gone on for decade after decade We should all want the same thing How can it be any different than those thingsThe more bitter you become the more we will appeal to love and patriotism and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great countryTo celebrate Americas majestic inheritance yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brandnew monument to our most beloved icons The National Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community and from every place and from every part of our nation Great men and great women people that we can look up to foreverFamilies will be able to walk among the statues of titans and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends And why dont we start with a man who has been very unfairly treated who two years ago three years ago especially five or six years ago people would have said its impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success George Washington Thomas Jefferson Betsy Ross Alexander Hamilton Benjamin Franklin John Adams James Madison Dolly Madison The great Frederick Douglass Abraham Lincoln Harriet Tubman Harriet Beecher Stowe Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain Clara Barton Daniel Boone Davy Crockett Henry Clay Susan B Anthony Booker T Washington Orville and Wilbur Wright who are looking downAnd youre going to see some planes like you have never seen before because we build them better than anybody in the world The greatest Air Force the greatest fighters the greatest everything Youre going to be seeing something I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that But theyre looking Theyre checking it out right now along with us Amelia Earhart A great great athlete no matter where he went he was the best athlete Jackie Robinson George S Patton General Patton He didnt know how to lose He didnt dont how to lose General Douglas MacArthur Audie Murphy The great Billy Graham And an incredible man respected by everybody Martin Luther King President Ronald Reagan Christa McAuliffe and Antonin Scalia So those are just a few of the people well be naming and things are subject to change but once we make that decision those great names are going to be up there and theyre never coming down They have just been an incredible group And we are going to do this in a very democratic way frankly Were going to take names and suggestions Were going to have committees and were going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known The most respected people The people that helped us the most And the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say Isnt America just a tremendous place So thank you That will be very excitingThe patriots who built our country were not villains they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the Earth beyond measureThe beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice to heal division and to continue the work of our Founding Fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America If you believe in justice if you believe in freedom if you believe in peace then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our Constitution It is our founding and our Constitution It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved Thats why our country is so strong even despite terrible things that happen over the generationsHere this evening are a number of heroes who risk their own lives to uphold these values and keep our communities and our country safe We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines protecting our cities many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man Fallen Officer David Dorn a 38year veteran of the St Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending And to Davids great family I want to thank you very much The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement And nobody nobody embodies that better than David Thank you very much Please And David is looking down right now and he is so proud of you and he loves you so much And thank you for being here Hes a great man Hes a great manFinally tonight we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States Military Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good Battlefields across the world and here at home are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this Earth to secure liberty and peace Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free These are great great people These are great great heroes indeed And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see You know that This will make our country even stronger long into the futureIn a few moments we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II They raced through the skies of Koreas MiG Alley They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam They delivered a swift and swip and you know that sweeping it was swift and it was sweeping like nobody has ever seen anything happen a victory in Operation Desert Storm A lot of you were involved in that A lot of you were involved That was a quick one And they have gone on to dangerous missions around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safelyAs you know weve killed this last year the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years alBaghdadi and Soleimani Killed Gone Over We have worked to fully rebuild the Armed Forces of the United States No enemy on Earth stands a chance 25 trillion weve invested all made in the USA Weve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now We did that over the last three yearsEverywhere these aircraft have flown theyve rained down American thunder delivered American justice and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereigntyIn their steel frames broad wings and roaring engines we see the story of Americas daring defiance its soaring spirit and undying resolveThroughout our history our country has been tested and tried but we have always fought to victory Whenever our way of life has been threatened our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence We are Americans and we never back down we never give in and we never give up and we will never yield in defense of our nation We love our nation We will only fight to winToday we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of libertyWe honor the legends of our history the glories of our Founding Fathers and the giants of the past and the heroes of today who keep us safe who keep us strong and proud and who keep us freeOnce again Happy July Fourth to all Our
